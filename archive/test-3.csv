17898,399587683,4,Fun contemporary (diverse) romance,,"Note: an eARC of this title was acquired via NetGalley.Y'ALL.Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely adored The Proposal. Jasmine Guillory is a fantastic writer, full-stop, and her sophomore novel was a fun contemporary romance that treated its characters (and readers) like competent adults. There was dramatic tension, but it didn't feel like the characters made stupid, dumb choices JUST to move the plot forward. They communicated with one another the way people do in real life and disagreements happened because of what each character SAID to one another, not because they didn't talk to begin with. (Such gasp. Much shock. So horror.)Both the two leads and everyone else were diverse in some way, but no one's backstory or motivations felt contrived or there to only serve a narrative purpose. Like, this novel was just so refreshing and makes you question the romance genre as a whole. Why can't other novels have functioning adults as their protagonists? Why can't there be more than just straight white people falling in love?? Why can't more intersectional stories cross over into the mainstream???I was definitely aware of Guillory's debut, The Wedding Date, earlier this year (an #OwnVoices contemporary romance raved by Roxane Gay!), so I really wanted to read The Proposal as soon as it was published. (Because duh that cover and that summary.) AND LET ME TELL YOU. It delivered. The Proposal could have been any other romance, but because Guillory is so precise in her characterizations, it made sense that THESE characters in THIS setting had THESE things happen to them. The sex scenes weren't gratuitous but they didn't feel safe for work, either. And I know the timeline in which her protagonists fall in love is, in theory, very short, but it's also like why is this taking so long?? ??HUR??RY??UP??Honestly, the only thing that I disliked was that the damn book ended. I could see that the pages left were getting smaller and smaller, but I was also like no??? maybe don't?? And then when Nik and Carlos FINALLY get their Happily Ever After, I turned the page and there was a biography of Guillory instead of more story. (How dare she.)I know that both The Wedding Date and next summer's The Wedding Party take place in the same universe, but that's kind of not the same thing and I am very, very sad I can no longer read this book for the first time.",FALSE,romance,0,1,

Yea--thats how I felt listening to the audio book.  I took it on a long driving trip.  I think the author must fancy herself as Elizabeth Browning, with the endless descriptions of the intricacies of flower arranging.  After a very long period where the protagonist simply lives in a fog and drags the reader through her depressing fugue state, the protagonist just suddenly wakes up and changes, but there didn't seem to be a catalyst.  Or maybe there was, but didn't notice because my ears were too numb from the endless descriptive scenes that are supposed to give the reader a break from the suspense and action, but really didn't do the job because they droned on and on.

2193,1451673310,5,A demonstration of a vanishing art,One person found this helpful,"Fahrenheit 451 should probably be required reading in a few different venues. First, despite its origins in the 1950s, it is remarkably prescient of the effect of technology on literacy; after reading F451, you'll think twice about the next person you see plugged too deeply into facebook on their smart phone. Second, this story should be required reading for the average fiction self-publisher making use of Amazon's Kindle store to hawk their wares. I think F451 exemplifies a style of lyrical, poetic writing combined with a succinct, poignant plot that is disappearing out of the English language in favor of meandering, violent, pointless garbage. The mastery of language in this story should cause every self-publisher to look closely at their own work and to think twice about jumping the gun to hit the 'publish' button. It seems to me that many don't have the sense to know they're not done writing yet. Thirdly, and finally, this story should be required reading for the modern casual fiction reader; again, to see how writing has changed in the last sixty years and also to place an education in the audience sufficient to know what the art of polished writing actually looks like. A reader thus equipped will give self-publishers the correct reviews necessary to make the sorry pseudocreators polluting the field think twice about besmirching the English language. If there is no publisher to step in and stop crap at the source, the audience must be well enough read to be discriminating in the publisher's place.It is freedom of speech for everyone to be allowed to speak their mind, but it is also necessary for future creators to have the education and self-control to muzzle themselves when they have nothing to say --especially if there's no discriminating publisher to step in and stop them when they need stopping. Not every drabble should be sold. Everybody is allowed to speak, but people should understand that those speaking do not always have anything to say. Whoever you are as a writer, aspire to match a master like Bradbury. Whoever you are as a reader, expect what you read to be produced by a master like Bradbury.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,
1015,B01IW9TM5O,5,South Africa from the Coloured Experience,11 people found this helpful,"This book was VERY hard for me to put down!  Knowing a great deal about the apartheid era, it was most interesting to see this moral outrage from the perspective of a ""coloured"" person (i.e. born of mixed blood).  The coloured were badly discriminated by both the whites and blacks; Trevor in a most sensitive and informing manner gave the perspective of social rejection.  Many believe that had the ""coloured"" been treated as ""honorary whites"" apartheid could have lasted much longer.  The genius of apartheid was that it leveraged on race and tribe against the other.  Zulu against Xhosa is a good example.  Indians were also victims of apartheid although much better off than blacks.  I find it amazing that apartheid almost inspired cruel burlesques upon the system.  Example, Chinese were considered ""black"" because the system couldn't really define them but Japanese were ""honorary whites"" and treated accordingly; maybe the construction of a Toyota plant in Port Elizabeth raised the status of wealthy Japanese businessmen.  Now that apartheid has been swept away, the next big challenge for South Africa is tribalism which is the bane of Africa.Trevor gives a good lesson we in America could find as a cautionary tale.  I find that Democrats and Republicans even are becoming ""tribal"" to some extent; i.e. lack  of civility.  Racial resentment between Latino and Blacks is evident in major cities where like South Africa the resentment was fueled by poverty and a lack of middle class jobs.  I am a older white American and instead of wasting this story with a person my own age I intend to give my copy to my 19 year old nephew.

1581,786965606,3,Not an OSR System,7 people found this helpful,"Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition was meant as an apology for the blasphemy of 4th Edition. WoTC promised they were going back to the roots of the series in order to bring back fans of all previous editions including AD&D, which encapsulated  D&D before 3rd edition. Despite covering a lot of distance from 4e, they haven't traveled close enough for their promise to have been held. Instead, it feels like a hybrid between 3rd and 4th edition which can't shake its video game inspired roots. A number of mechanics prevent 5th edition from recapturing the spirit, intent, and art of roleplaying of the AD&D systems.There is No Weight to Death :Characters have far too many stop-gaps saving them from death for it to have any real importance. First, they don't die at zero hitpoints; They are knocked unconscious. Then, they must fail 3 unmodified saving throws by rolling 1-9 on a D20 each round until 3 success or 3 failures are rolled. which works out to approximately 36.5% chance to fail 3 with a 63.5% chance to succeed(not factoring critical effects). All it takes to prevent those rolls is 1 round of assistance from someone to stabilize the character. If the rolls result in 3 successes, the character automatically stabilizes.If a character does die, resurrection is common enough that it could be used with no penalty other than a medium cost. There are no permanent penalties, such as constitution loss, which means characters can be resurrected with impunity. Most of the time, one need not worry about getting to this point anyway, as it is truly trivial to keep characters away from death's door.The problem with 5th edition's death mechanic is the absence of genuine tension or punishment. At most, characters can view the fabled death effect as if it were a mere inconvenience; it leads to players having a constant set of training wheels allowing reckless behavior with few opportunities to lose. As established, there is essentially an entitlement afforded to players which disallows them a wide range of potential emotional investment and rich, immersive tension.Monster Abilities are Luke  Warm at Best:Monster abilities in 5e have no lasting consequence. Permanent effects are completely removed. Most dangerous abilities which could kill a player must overcome a statistical lottery of dice rolling, and many intelligent or legendary monsters have had their attack routines codified to the point of yawn worthy predictability. Dragons, for example, now do ""Kewl Pow3rs"" like summoning magma from the ground every 2 rounds. There isn't anything close to the rich,creative and free form abilities as exist in the 2nd edition Monster Manual, nor are any of the monsters worthy of fear; there no level drains, permanent stone effects, long duration charms or Save or Die effects to really make players invested into the scene.The problem with monster design in 5e  is the considerable adherence  to recreating MMO style encounters rather than believable fantasy encounters. At best, the players could be set back, but at worst, the players can easily memorize the single minded strategy of each monster. The only counter to this would be an incredibly skilled and motivated DM who takes the initiative to rework them in ways which result in true challenge not dependent upon numeric advantage. For those who are learning the art of DMing or just playing straight by the book, players have little to fear nor should they expect many surprises.Cantrips Make Magic Average:Cantrips are the magical version of a sword swing. They have no use limit, no cost, and require no other investment to use, yet they do everything from telekinesis to area of effect damage. While they are not as powerful as traditional spells, they can fulfill the same creative utility sans the cost or trade off of casting a full spell. Limitless magic like this drastically reduces the awe of magic and pushes it into the mire of mundane occurrences. Rather than require spellusers to ration their magic and plan accordingly, they got an infinite reservoir of useful abilities to fallback on whenever they need them. There isn't a way to overstate how significant of a blow this is to the traditional gritty feel and believable limitations of Ad&d's rich strategic layer.The Unique Snowflake Syndrome:Despite having the opportunity to move away from D&D 3rd and 4th edition class and race bloat, WoTC make it a central element.They have no fewer than 5 melee classes and more ways to say: ""I'm a magic user"" than one could shake a stick at. Each of them have a different set of abilities which are segregated into paths called ""Archetypes"" which reflect subclass customization. Want to be a Fighter who casts magic, or a Fighter who Commands?; the number of choices varies with each class.Some may argue that variety is good, but when you factor in player psychology, you realize it slows things down and destroys balance. Players get choice paralysis very easily; it is especially true for new players. So many options discourages players from making new characters as it is a dauntingly involved process. While it's not as bad as other editions, it's significantly more involved than AD&D. One can see why character death is so rare by envisioning what it would be like to have to make a new character every session. You have to choose among backgrounds, where to place stat rolls, archetypes, ""choose one of:"" type options etc. Some of these will need to be made each time a character levels up like feats and stat increases which scale with level. All of these distract from the in game role playing and emphasize meta gaming on a level squarely reminiscent, though much reduced , of 3rd edition, 4th edition and the video game mentality in general.Balance is inherently reduced using this approach because of considerable niche overlap. There are only so many ways to hit an enemy with a melee weapon so why have so many classes which do just that? It merely makes classes have to compete with each other to share the same role. Having simple classes which focus on different elements of the games prevents contact friction and enhances individuality through roleplay instead of through character generation.Roll Play:If official adventures from WoTC are any indication of how D&D 5th edition was meant to be played, it's clear that player involvement is relegated to mere die rolling. The existence of passive perception and other passive saves means that characters can automatically detect much of their environment with little to no choice or thought on the players part. If a trap isn't automatically discovered passively, the DM is advised to give the player an active perception check to find it. Should he fail that, he then gets another save to avoid the effects of the trap. On a bad day, this would subject the average character to no more than a 25% chance to ever fall victim to a trap.  What is the point to a player if his character could literally autopilot to victory 75% of the time? Now, of course no two traps are the same; nothing prevents a DM from making deadlier traps either, but WoTC's official publications and blatant autopilot save system clearly indicates such an approach is not the default method. Unfortunately, this removes the player from the equation and makes him little more than a die rolling machine.  WoTC is clearly lowering the bar so as to cater to the largest possible crowd - something which is most certainly not in accordance with the demand of player skill existing in Ad&d and the OSR genre in general.Emphasis on die rolling also contributes to odd and illogical inconsistencies. At one point in an official adventure known as Phandelver, a significant plot point is obfuscated from view unless the players actively make a perception roll. If they fail, they don't find a key plot pathway. If WoTC wanted that to be a fun event, it would be best to let the players search for it themselves, or, if it were so integral to the story line, simply have the DM inform them to begin with and move on to far less petty activities. While not a part of the system itself, it's clear that the system was designed to be applied in this manner. After all, if the developers are playing wrong, who isn't?Combats are Still Slow:Yes, they have reduced the number of modifiers and reigned in on much of the conditional bloat of 4th edition, but they retained a number of features from both 3rd edition and 4th edition which, when combined with new mechanics such as advantage, result in an excessive amount of die rolling. Advantage/Disadvantage aimed to reduce the number of modifiers; it did this at the expense of introducing more die rolls and reducing the granularity of effects and situations which should have nuanced influence. Decision paralysis still exists because each class has multiple abilities to decide on at the start of any round, and most classes get a considerable number of die rolls due to number of attacks and other special abilities. Coupled with the watered down monster abilities, 5th edition combat still feels like a cross between 3rd and 4th edition without any real resemblance to Ad&d, whose combat is both simpler and more tactically rewarding without advantage and disadvantage's blunt countering.Politics has no Place in a Medieval Fantasy RPG:Keep politics out of it. It's not the place to subliminally advertise inclusivity, nor is it the place to make so much noise about gender roles or gender neutral assignments especially when such inclusions reflect such a small (<4%) potential pool of customers. WoTC may as well do the same for everyone who suffers asthma and thus can't match the athleticism of their characters, or  is less tall than the smallest printed human size so as to not make them feel degraded. Leave the slippery slopes to real life. Show relevance through design of a game system people want to play. It's not important to know an author's  political stance.Conclusion:Dungeon & Dragons 5th edition isn't  a bad system. There is nothing which makes it unfun, nor is there anything which bogs it down into neigh un-playability like high level Pathfinder and 4e, but the feel is not genuinely representative of pre-3rd edition D&D. If it weren't for WoTC advertising it as an OSR inspired and directed product, then no harm would have been done; Unfortunately, they did. In doing so, they made what feels to be a blatantly subliminal attempt at redefining the meaning of OSR through their considerable market influence so as to win over a share of the crowd; all  without actually making any sacrifice of their new found fan base. The result is a system which attempts to be a jack of all trades with a sizable fraction of its energy devoted towards the newer school of  thought. This approach leads to jarring inconsistencies regarding the theme of believable fantasy. It often times has a very hard time shaking off its clearly video game inspired mechanical assumptions.For people who want a rich experience which embodies all flavors of RPGs, I recommend them to get the 2nd Edition Dungeons & Dragons system. There you will find D&D as it was envisioned. 5th edition is not a good place to learn about what D&D is all about because it simply does not embody what the creator of the entire series wanted people to experience. With 5th edition, you will only get a certain type of experience which is heavily focused on game mechanics and significantly less focused on role playing. If you want to learn the art of Role Playing, go with 2nd edition. If you want to simply play a fun game, this will do.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,0,0,

1167,B01IW9TM5O,5,Beautiful ??,3 people found this helpful,"Let me tell you something, I love Trevor Noah. Big fan of The Daily Show, stand-up specials on Netflix, and his way of thinking. This guy is just naturally hilarious and apparently, he is also a relevant author. “Born A Crime” is everything I thought it would be, with just a little extra something. Funny story, I tried all of 2018 trying to get a hard copy of Trevor’s novel, but it was either sold out or too expensive, until I finally got it for a fair price and new!Anyways, in his memoir, Trevor introduces his lifestyle in South Africa and how his mother taught his to me the man he is today. Noah talks about the struggles that apartheid injected to his life as a child, and how his mother persevered in a world that kept throwing obstacles at her. Not only did I learn about his childhood and adolescent life, but about his father and the domestic violence his mother endured with Trevor’s step-father.??Trevor Noah’s story is just difficult to digest. Yes, the comedy that is present is entertaining and you’re laughing most of the time while reading, but there’s parts I was just in shock. If I though I was poor growing up in a 2 bedroom apartment, it doesn’t compare to where Trevor was. By any means, he literally made me appreciate the life I thought was not that great. As a child, you don’t really know the problems parents go through, yet is the happiest time of your life.Last night when I was finishing “Born A Crime”, I was tearing up, because his story is so powerful and raw. There’s no filter and it made me realize that Trevor is where he is now because of two things; he got a job that he loves and he listened to his mother’s advice. ??",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,

I loved the relationships between the characters, and how the stereotype of ""greasers"" and ""socs"" was broken; they were all just people. I especially loved the relationship between Ponyboy and his brothers. I don't have any brothers, but reading this book made me want one (or two) older brothers to look out for me like Soda and Darry did for Ponyboy. When I heard about this book, I didn't think I would like it because I'm not usually into gangs and such. But now this is my favorite book! I highly recommend this book!!",TRUE,children,1,1,
17101,1501128019,5,The Meaningfulness of Words,,"I’m a lover and a teacher of words, so I definitely understand the power they can wield. Words can both harm and heal…both uplift and destroy. Their effect on people is based on the decisions of the speaker and the reactions of the listener, and as Joyce Meyer explains, ‘words are containers for power, you choose what kind of power they carry.’As childhood friends, Macy Sorensen and Elliot Petropoulos bonded through their love of words and all that came with them, and the more time they spent together, the easier it became to transition from friends to lovers, but as the saying goes, ‘sometimes love just isn’t enough,’ and for reasons, unbeknownst to readers, their love and bond couldn’t last, so when we first meet Macy and fate puts Elliot in her path, the boy she hasn’t seen for more than a decade, all we can do is trust in the words that Christina Lauren use to tell Macy and Elliot’s story because it’s more than apparent from that singular moment in time that their journey together never completely ended, and that’s exactly what the writers give readers, and as we travel back to the whys and hows of Macy and Elliot forming a friendship and then a romantic relationship, we constantly question what went wrong…what could have possibly happened to create a divide that left two people so in love from speaking to one another for over 10 years, and then as readers come back to Macy and Elliot’s present and witness their reactions to one another and how easily the memories of their time together plays out in their minds, the need to understand what happened and push for them to fix it overpowers us, and while readers’ patience will definitely be tested, when the details do come out and the extent of what occurred is revealed, it’s difficult to truly know how Macy and Elliot move forward, knowing that the past unequivocally brought them to their knees.Love and Other Words is an emotional journey told completely through Macy’s POV, and while Elliot’s perspective probably could have shed light on why Macy has spent the last decade crafting a carefully constructed and ordinary life, I feel like it has to be Macy’s story to tell because that’s the only way she’ll be able to heal and perhaps feel like she’s ready to shake up her routine and uneventful life.Christina Lauren is such a dynamic duo of storytellers; all of the words they choose to create their stories allow readers to transport themselves to the setting of the book and to place themselves in the minds of the main characters, and even though some readers might find it a bit confusing to switch between then and now when it comes to Macy and Elliot’s story, Christina Lauren uses seamless transitions so that it’s clear why the scenes from the past are next to the scenes from the present, and for a story like Love and Other Words, it is paramount that Macy and Elliot’s history be shared because without it, readers wouldn’t understand why their present turned out the way it did or why they have to fight against their past in order to give themselves a real shot at a future.4.5 Poison Apples",FALSE,romance,1,1,

In the first story, he was the no BS tell it like it is for Drew that everyone should have. In his own story, though, he seemed far less mature and rational, especially with how he handled things with Nik.At one point his irrational, out of left field behavior made me actually yell out, ""WHAT? Are you kidding me? Who does that?"" Yeah, he irritated me here and I was so disappointed with this book.Nik was okay, but she didn't leave too much of an impression on me. The diverse cast of supporting characters was nice, and I was more interested in them as well as Carlos' sister and cousin than in either of the main characters.

January Andrews moves into a beach house she inherited from her father, only to find out that her college rival Augustus Everett lives next door.  January writes romances and Augustus is known for literary fiction.  They get off on the wrong foot (of course)... attempt to avoid each other, and then eventually concoct a bet to get out of their respective writing ruts. January has to write something literary and August is supposed to write something romantic.  But throughout the course of the summer, they learn so much about each other and from each other as they write books outside of their comfort zone. Emily Henry does a wonderful job of re-inventing the enemies-turned-lovers trope.  January and Gus are great characters with wonderful development and depth. The story behind the romance was heartfelt as well.

In the new book, the author Alice Schertle's  great rhymes are back and the illustrations by Jill McElmurry are cute and fun once again.When I pre-ordered my copy of the book, there wasn't a product description, so I was happily surprised when I discovered it has flaps which you lift to see what is underneath.  The concept is that each of our favorite animals are in the book once again and most are in costume.  You lift the flap to see which animal is “hidden” under their mask.  I really appreciate that it helps re-enforce animal names while a child has fun with guessing and enjoying the cute costumes.  The back page is an entire flip-over page and reveals the biggest costumed entity as well.  Don't want to ruin the big surprise but don't be surprised is there are a few “Beep, beep, beeps” to be read.I purchased one copy thinking it would be enough for both of my grandchildren but, as it turns out, my grandson likes it so well, he wants it kept by the rocking chair in his room at my house.

5726,670062510,5,The Ouroboros of YA literature,,"Rereading this classic was a joy. No need to summarize the plot or describe the characters, since most of you reading this likely know a good deal about both, whether you have already read this novel or not. The Outsiders is one of the first—if not *the* first—Young Adult novel to take adolescents seriously, as complex human beings with inner conflicts and genuinely profound dilemmas that truly matter.Yes, it has some drawbacks. Although it was written by a woman, it features just two female characters, only one of whom matters to the plot, albeit in a very limited manner. It contains no racial or ethnic diversity, so it loses points in terms of representation. The novel does, however, foreground issues of social class and economic inequality—matters that make rare appearances in contemporary YA texts, let alone any texts in 1967, when it was originally published.It is foundational. And if you might think the text is somewhat simple and unsophisticated, just take a look at its final sentences, which are also its opening sentences.

I don't get what is violent about this book and I think the person who rated this book as ""Horrible and Violent book"" does not really understand the book.1. The reason why the story tells a boy(Johnny) getting abused by his father is to tell the readers that Johhny would never know what the love and affection are without his buddies.2. The boy(Ponyboy) was getting drowned by the ""Socs(Socials)"" because Ponyboy and Johnny was a ""Greaser(Hoods)"" meaning they were like Criminals(junivile delinquents) and that's how people look at Greasers, while people like Socs because they have clean hair wearing madras shirts and riding corvairs and stuff.3. Ponyboy mentioned ""Electric chair"" because an incident happened and he was terrified that they'll get a bigger consequences than Socs because they're Greasers. Johnny killed a Soc with a switchblade because Ponyboy was getting drowned by a Soc and Bob(one of the Socs) scared Johnny to kill him. Johnny also killed Bob because he's the one who nearly beat him to death and left him at the lot(flashback).4. Johnny and Ponyboy hurried and left the scene, and went to find Dally(one of their buddies). He was in a party and when Dally told them that he was sleeping in a bed, he also mentioned that he was actually(literally) sleeping, doing nothing else.5. Sodapop(Ponyboy's older brother) had a girlfriend named Sandy, and he wanted to marry her but she left him because he was a Greaser and didn't even graduate highschool. Not because she was pregnant. Sodapop really liked her but she didn't realize that his feelings were true.6. A girl named Cherry was also a Soc, and got in the car with other Socs not guys. She got in a car because one of them was her boyfriend and she couldn't stand fights(The Socs called Greasers in a mean way and Ponyboy's buddy Two-Bit held his switchblade and gave Ponyboy a busted glass bottle). You also can realize that even though Cherry is a Soc, she isn't mean to Greasers like other Socs.7. When Ponyboy and Johnny met Dally and told him what happened, he told them there was a old Church at Windrixvile and that they can stay there while things are settled up. The church one day caught on fire and Ponyboy and Johnny tried to save the kids. Ponyboy was able to get out of the burning church but Johnny passed out before he got out of the church.Ponyboy was fine, One of Dally's arm got little burned but he was okay, Johnny's back was broken and he had a bad burn and eventually died.8. When Dally heard that Johnny died, he couldn't take it because he loved Johnny so much(like a brother) and broke in a store and got shot by the cops because that's what he wanted.9. Also Johnny once said to Ponyboy that he wants to kill himself but while he was in a hospital dying, he told Ponyboy that he doesn't want to die anymore. Johnny thought dying at age of 16 is not enough and wanted to learn more things in his life.It's an awesome book if you know the meanings of the popular quotes such as ""Stay gold ponyboy, stay gold"" meaning good things also has an end to it(I think) and it's also helpful to review the poem ""Nothing gold can stay"" by Robert Frost.",TRUE,children,1,1,

The core rules are elegantly simple, while the classes, races and spells are full of interesting options and details for the players without being overly complex. The system also has a spell or ability that covers everything a fantasy character SHOULD be able to do, without making any of those options overpowered (for example, the wizards has the full of variety of spells and spell effects you would expect from 2nd/3rd edition, you just can't do it all at the same time and no effect is overpoweringly effective).  There's also a profound respect for including mechanics that cater to different playstyles, from rules for character-oriented roleplaying to a feat that gives all classes access to rules evoking 4th edition's tactical combat.  I won't say it's flawless--some may wish the core mechanics had a few more options, and the shallower curve of the stats, while a good thing, mayhave issues--but this is by far the smoothest running version of DnD I've played (and I've played 2nd through 5th).",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,

8311,1484707230,5,"Really good book, teaches you some greek mythology, and offers you great entertainment.",One person found this helpful,"This review is by my 9-year-old son Anay.One reason why Percy Jackson is a really good book is that there are Greek gods and monsters. For example, in book 1 Percy meets Zeus, in book 3 he meets Dionysus, and in book 5 he meets the whole counsel. I think Greek gods are cool because they are powerful allies but make deadly enemies. For example, when Apollo and Artemis’s mother Leto was ambushed by a giant, she called them and they arrived and killed the giant. This shows how powerful and interesting the Greek gods are. Because there are Greek gods and monsters, you can even learn some Greek mythology which might come in handy in a history test. So Percy Jackson is sort of realistic fiction. Moving on, another reason why Percy Jackson is a really good book is that Percy has cool powers and stays in a cool camp. For example, Percy can control water, the camp has a cool armory and arena, and because he can speak to fish and horses. Percy is able to speak to Pegasus because Pegasus is part horse so he can ask Pegasus for help. Although Percy Jackson is a really good book because of Greek mythology and his powers and home, I think the most important reason is that he goes on an interesting quest in every book. For example, in book 1, Percy goes on a quest for the lightning bolt, in book 2 he finds the golden fleece, and in book 3 Percy finds the “beast” that can destroy the Olympians. The quests are really cool because a lot of adventure happens in them. All in all, I hope that I have convinced you that Percy Jackson is a really good book because Percy has cool powers and home, there are Greek gods, and most of all because Percy goes on an interesting quest in every book.",TRUE,children,1,1,

1816,786965606,5,Great Introduction to a Great Game!,5 people found this helpful,"As a brand new D&D player, this book was amazing!A friend finally, after YEARS, pestered me into joining her in entering this world of D&D, and after the first two meetings I had with her I HAD to buy this book. Even before making it to an actual game session, I had so much fun reading through all the different classes and characters, and had an absolute blast making my own. I ended up making... twelve(?) characters, just for fun. The rules and descriptions are written out pretty well, and I've never had any problems reading it. However, my friend's relatives, who played in 2 and 3e, hate it, because ""its so different"" and are having issues adjusting to new rules. Rules that I have read and seem very concise to me make no sense to them, so be warned about switching to 5e if you're a vet player.Now while I LOVE this book and this game, I'm going to talk about its flaws more than anything else, just to give warning to issues I faced, since there isn't much more I can say on the positive side. It was great... now what?My main issue is that there is a lot of... fluff for lack of a better word. Its not that the book is drawn out, but throughout the first several chapters they start explaining certain things (like dice checks, equipment, magic) but then the book just tells you ABOUT the thing and not the rules, how it applies, when to use it, ect, and instead directs you to another chapter in the book that doesn't actually explain that extensively. I'm still having a very hard time understanding saving throws and the difference between a saving through and a dice check, which isn't helped by the relatives telling me things from old versions that isn't ANYWHERE in the book. Conversely, it spends a lot of time explaining what the character is doing, rather than how to do it over the course of the rolls. When explaining ability checks, for example, it goes over EVERY SINGLE ability check in the terms of what the character is doing, rather then telling me what to roll, what modifiers to add, and what I am rolling against. Obviously a charisma check is for talking to people and strength is for physical endeavors. How about telling me how these apply to my actual rolls rather than telling me what my character is doing?Also, all the spells are collected in one giant mess in the BACK of the book. Chapter 10 is all the rules of magic (which falls prey to the same issue I had above), but chapter 11 is nothing but a LONG list of spells. The first several pages of this chapter break down into a list the names of the spells that each class can get and what the levels of the spells are. Then it goes into a very detailed list talking about each individual spell in alphabetical order, regardless of class functions as many of the spells overlap. While not the end of the world, flipping back and forth from the class description and abilities to the class spell list to the actual spell is a bit frustrating. Keep that in mind, when gaining new spells, there are THREE locations you need to keep on tab. I suggest buying a pack of index cards and writing down the entire spell details on one for when you are actually playing. Having to try and find the spell you're looking for while fighting SUCKS.All that aside, I strongly recommend grabbing this book, for new players and old! If you're going to be playing with a group, go ahead and snatch up your own copy. We tried to manage a five player and one DM group on one handbook... that was a massive mistake. We now have three and I still dread leveling up or starting new campaigns because it takes FOREVER to go through and update/make characters when sharing books. The book is honestly fun to read, even without the premise of actually playing. Come, join us in the world of D&D!",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,

190,451524934,5,1984 a 21st Century Novel,3 people found this helpful,"George Orwell's last book - 1984 was published in 1949 for the first time. It has since been reprinted in 1961, 1977, 1981 and 2003.Many reviews have been written. I do not presume to have anything new to say about the book.  As the author of the foreword of the Centennial Edition, Thomas Pynchon, observed ""It is not difficult to guess that Orwell, in 1984, was imagining a future for his son's generation, a world he was not so much wishing upon them as warning against. He was impatient with predictions of the inevitable, he remained confident in the ability of ordinary people to change anything, if they would."" It seems to be a thread woven through the book...""that human decency, like parental love, can always be taken for granted - a faith so honorable that we can almost imagine Orwell, and perhaps even ourselves, for a moment anyway, swearing to do whatever must be done to keep it from ever being betrayed.""  In his Afterword, Eric Fromm offers this observation. ""Orwell. . .is implying that the new form of managerial industrialism, in which man builds machines which act like men and develops men who act like machines, is conducive to an era of dehumanization and complete alienation, in which men are transformed into things and become appendices to the process and production and consumption...Orwell...is not a prophet of disaster. He wants to warn and awaken us....the danger with which all men are confronted today, the danger of a society of automatons who will have lost every trace of individuality, of love, of critical thought, and yet who will not be aware of it because of 'doublethink.'""Fromm continues ""Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings. and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.""As in all timeless creative writing Orwell has given us, the reader, many lessons.

She told me that Hinton's books were ""trash,"" and she didn't understand why I would waste my time reading them.

Gus calls January fairy princess because she writes romance and gives all her characters a happy ending, while he writes depressing literary fiction. They are complete opposites but they bring the best in each other.The book has two of my favorite tropes: second-chance and nemeses-to-lovers. And although Beach Read has a lot of funny moments, it also has some somber and more profound themes of loss, grief, and child abuse. This book satisfied a lot of my cravings. It was funny, angsty, emotional, and clever. I thought the ending was a little rushed, but maybe it was because I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters.

2869,B0176M3U10,5,ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL BOOKS OF 2016,5 people found this helpful,"HOLY WOW! It Ends With Us is one of the most powerful books of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I’ve ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It’s a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever been prouder of a heroine. I’ve loved Colleen Hoover’s books for a long time because she always writes unique stories… and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completely spoiler-free review. I’m not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It’s a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it’s amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I’m the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I’ve really learned to trust Colleen’s writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all… and I was blown away by the story!This book is unputdownable. You’ll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I didn’t finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I’ve ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn’t be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I’d want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don’t think I’ve been this proud of a fictional character before.There’s an incredibly powerful message in this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don’t yet realize how significant each of these moments truly are… and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I’m not mentioning it on purpose because I don’t want you to expect it. The fact that it’s unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it’s also unexpected for the heroine. As she begins to realize what kind of situation she’s in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journey with her.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the ‘love triangle’ because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don’t want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you’re thinking this book is, just trust me — it’s so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I’m always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time — not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant — and there’s this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such a strong impact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went ‘woah!’. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn’t possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make a seriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people — whether they’ve personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has — so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don’t want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time.

Both characters are grieving and find a support system within each other. I loved the development of their friendship, first. There were several scenes that made me laugh out loud, our Heroine is witty and I loved loved loved the banter between her and H.There were also scenes that made me ugly cry, so I'd say, go in prepared for a bit of an emotional roller coaster.

16646,1984806734,4,A well-balanced summer read,,"A solid 4 stars for Beach Read by Emily Henry. I learned about this book from Book of the Month but snagged a paperback copy during Target's ""Buy 2; Get 1"" sale this summer.The story is about two writers, January, who writes romance novels that are happily ever afters and Augustus, who is committed to dark literary fiction. The two genres and writers are as different as their seasonal names suggest (i.e., summer/winter). They have a history with one another dating back to their college days and consider each other literary rivals. Both writers are also at difficult points in their personal lives, suffering from writer's block in their professional ones, and just happen to be living in adjacent beach houses. Their professional troubles lead them to make a bet of sorts, January will write a literary fiction as her next novel and Augustus will write a romantic one for his. This agreement takes them on several adventures togethers, and as you might suspect, a friendship develops.By the cover, you might think this book is chick lit or a rom-com, and that would be true, there are some steamy scenes. However, the plot much deeper than romance. The personal issues the protagonists are struggling with are very real and somewhat dark. I picked up this book thinking I would get a light read, but I got more than I bargained for and I think it made for a successful story. A reader might be looking for a light, thoughtless read to push through the hot summer days, and there are plenty available. Beach Read is a little heavier, and as a more mature reader I appreciated the mix of light and dark.The reason for the lacking star is the slow start. It takes awhile for the author to build the story and early on the construction of her sentences made some parts difficult to understand causing me to have to re-read several sentences. I feel like about a third of the way into the book she found her rhythm and the pace picked up for me.Recommendation: It was a slow start but well worth the finish. A great beach read for my summer quarantine sans the beach.Until next time ...

Now why I wrote that it’s good and not great !! I had a lot of misprints in the book they were not printed correctly in the category that  it was suppose to be. This is why I would say that it’s not that great because when I’m going through the pages of the book with my son and he wants to go through all of the pages.  For an adult trying to skip through the pages cause doesn’t go alone with the theme of things lol him being a baby he wants you to say it point at it anyway  lol.  So I’m a little annoyed because it doesn’t fit into the category of the items that we’re are discussing.  Point in case  we from cars to veggies.  There’s no reason why vegetables should be in that category.  For me that’s frustrating all the books are not like but some are like 2 books so couldn’t give it five star. However I do like the book just wish it didn’t have any misprints. Check for misprints upon receiving your books.",TRUE,children,-1,-1,

197,451524934,5,"Classic read, although not really ""sci-fi""",5 people found this helpful,"It is shocking that the book was written in 1949 but the ideas seem so mind blowing even as I read today. Granted, I never gave much thoughts to dictatorship. I was actually born in 1984, in China. And conveniently I turned out not interested in politics and history at all. The only reason I read this book is because it's categorized as classic ""sci-fi"". But seems, there is no escape of politics after all. *spoiler alert* The book describes the journey to ultimate darkness. It reminds me of ""The Forever War"" and a Japanese anime called ""Evangeline"". They all to some extend depict the effort of diminishing individual differences and creating one unified consciousness for all mankind. It's ironic to see the ultimate development of human consciousness might be to destroy it for once and for all. The most interesting thing about 1984 is that O'Brian says the motivation of the Party is purely selfish and hunger of power. That in my opinion is the biggest weakness of the Party. What's good of ""power"", if you spend all your time defending it instead of indulging yourself in the benefits of having power? Surely the ""high"" would sometimes want to slack off and lay back with an empty mind, ironically, similar with the emptiness of the ""middle"" and the ""low""? Oppressing people seems such hard work. Even O'Brian knows he is worn and tired. And the book says itself the ""high"" often goes soft in history. I don't know how the Party gets around it just by ""knowing what it's doing"". Of course it might just be me being childish and naive while on the other hand, the inner party is bunch of super over-achievers. But to me, the real dangerous lunatics are the ones who actually believe what they do is for the mankind. Overall, I agree it is a classic read and deserves so much credits because it was written almost 70 years ago.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,

Sadly, this is a fail in my opinion.While not a die hard Smith fan, I liked him (generally speaking). However, this memoir has me changing my mind. Will has always come off as ""annoying"" to me and the first several chapters let me understand WHY. It's just who he IS. Initially, I was turning pages like lightning, at times laughing out loud and at others shaking my head at his profound ""corniness"". The stories were fun, interesting, and insightful.  His cockiness is present from the beginning, but not necessarily bothersome. Then, about halfway through, he takes a nosedive...The light-hearted story of Smith's life morphs into a self-important bragathon which is very hard to read. I didn't realize Will is SO full of himself! My goodness, there's one thing to be confident or competitive even, but this guy is downright arrogant! So many times, I've closed this book and put it to the side (because he was simply getting on my nerves).Another thing I didn't enjoy was the inssecant need to dumb things down. As a Philly native, it was nice to know most of his references to the city. However, the constant explanations of words and phrases was unnecessary and often condescending. I don't know much about Mark Manson but I imagine the many self-help/psychoanalysis portions are from him. I could do without these as they don't sound genuine and disrupt the natural flow.It seems the intention was to inspire and/or uplift, but to have the desired effect, Will Smith seriously needs a lesson in humility! I suppose it could possibly come at the very end as I have been 360+ pages in for months now and just can't finish the darn book! Sigh...Maybe I will come back to update, but it's not likely any stars will be gained. And for the record: I agree with Jada. NOT funny. AT ALL.**UPDATE**I finally finished the book!

It also has a very nice bit of feeling of oldschool '30s ""Weird tales"" style Pulp stories that Gary Gygax used as the inspiration for D&D in the first place.  The art in the book is also excellent, well-done and using a classic fantasy style, instead of the ""dungeonpunk"" style of the previous two editions, which wore very thin after being severely overused for nearly every illustration.I was all prepared to dislike (even hate) this new edition of D&D, but after reading this book I am willing to say this might just possibly be the best edition of D&D yet, which is not something I ever thought I would say.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,

We may have learnt it as a vocabulary word or maybe as a general knowledge term or maybe as a chapter in a history/ civics class but you read the book and then it hits you - the enormity of this one word. The pain, the suffering, the so lopsided and so deeply unfair power weilding of one human race over another.Noah calls his existence a crime because during his time the union between a white and black was just that - a criminal offence. The book details his journey as a teen struggling in this society trying to find his identity and justification of his existence. He details his relationship with his equally rebellious mother and the time he enjoyed with his father. I wish he would say more about his emergence as a comedian and how he ended up across the Atlantic but maybe that is another book. For now this book is an eye opener at least for the uninitiated as me into the dark realities of aparthaeid and the life and struggles of a biracial human.Its Trevor Noahs book, humor is inevitable and there is lots of it and does help ease the heartache that is bound to accompany  you as u progress into the book.Very good read indeed.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,

1585,786965606,5,I pretty much ignored 3,8 people found this helpful,"I started playing D&D 28 yrs ago as a player in 1st ed.  I then went on to run several long campaigns in 2nd ed, including through the ""Players Options"" period towards the end.  I pretty much ignored 3.0, and took some time off.  3.5 got me fired up and I ran 2 more long campaigns with those rules, one of which I continue to run currently.  Never touched 4th.  I've been ignoring 5th, and Pathfinder for that matter, because I'm so heavily invested in my current campaign and I don't just drop things and start over because ""newer, cooler"" stuff comes out.3.5 really began bothering me once my group hit 9th level or so.  I still considered myself new to it, I had never played high levels in it, and I held out with 2nd ed. for so long I totally missed 3.0, and frankly, by the time I started playing 3.5 it was very old.  So I really didn't know what to expect from 3.5 and it takes me a couple years to really grasp all the pros and cons of a system, and also to understand the way it's rules subtly effect the way people play, and the actual flavor of the game.  Going into it, I was excited about 3.5.  They appeared to both streamline and unify things with the d20 core mechanic.  I liked what they did with the classes.  I likes the artwork, and I thought the indepth skill system and the idea behind feats were both really cool..in theory...In play, as both player and DM there was this feeling of being held back, and it was hard to pin down, and it just got worse the longer I played.  3.5 was difficult to run if you honor the rules and like to do things legit like I do.  Don't get me wrong, winging it is a time honered tradition and an artform I love, but I also enjoy keeping to the rules in a way that feels both realistic and fun for everyone.  I believe the  very rules of the game themselves can be a inspiration for stories, themes, and ideas, for both players and dms.Anyways, I'll stop now because this is not supposed to be a review of 3.5.Got the 5th ed PHB.  I was blown away.  This reminded me of something that had almost died, a deep desire to imagine and play, it reminded me why I love this game so much, and it really brought me back to the kind of game I want to be playing.  Here are the highlights 5th ed has added or changed:-First, I applaud the writers.  3.5 edition books were tedious to read.  The rules read like text from a technical manual.  The fluff was either cliche, or trying so hard to be different that it came across again as, cliche. This entire book is just interesting and inspiring to read.  I literally get adventure ideas from every other paragraph, it's just easy enough that you could hand it to your little brother and he could struggle through it, yet rich enough, deep enough, intelligent enough that you don't feel lame reading it as an adult.-The have made your character's background actually important.  For instance, if you're fighter was a criminal, he might be really good a sneaking around in addition to beating people up, but it he grew up in a temple, he might be versed on religious studies, as so fourth.  Each character picks a background which gives them a few skills and a lot of flavor.  There's more to it, but it's nice this game has finally brought character background into the mix in a formal way, instead of being just this thing you ""should come up with"", that a lot of people ignore, or gloss over.  Where you came from now effects your character, and at the same time gives you another layer of customization without complicating things too much.-Combat is less herky-jerky.  They've somehow simplified things without taking away variety.  In fact, in a couple sessions I played, it just felt like you could get more done with your round.  They've also added in reactions, so different classes have the opportunity to interrupt the flow of the round and sneak something in that can change the battle or save the day.  People have a lot more reason to pay attention when it's not their turn, because they may have a chance to act.-They changed the way spells work in a way that nearly brought tears to my eyes...so much simpler, much more flexible, and still all the variety there was before in spells.All in all I can't put this book down and can't wait to start a new group.  5th edition appears to really empower the DM, without taking away options from the players.  I don't know if this makes sense to anyone, but the direction 5th is taking feels more like a fantasy game, and less like a superhero game.  It feels a bit like 2nd edition, but still keeps the d20 core mechanic, and makes tangible, rather brilliant improvements on many areas of the game.  I have to applaud WOtC, for doing this right beyond what I thought was possible.  I didn't know if the spirit of the game could be recaptured after 3.5 and from what I've heard, 4th ed, turned it into an escalating numbers game that felt like WOW on paper.  The rules add to the story now, instead of burdening it.  The rules make combat exciting now instead of slowing it down.  Magic feels magical again instead of being a handful of dice doing fire damage.  D&D is back, it had regained its soul.  If you've been out of the game for years because it just stopped feeling right to you, if you miss the game, if you're playing Pathfinder/3.5 but you're tired of the cold war/numbers escalations between you and your DM, and especially if you're tired of battles taking 3+hours, and being mentally exhausted because of the constant need to track so many numbers, if you're a gamer and you're curious about the godfather of all games, you should really check this out.  There is so much content and flavor in this book.  I paid $30 for it but would have been just as excited to pay more for it...it's just the best thing I've seen in some time.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,

15787,1984806734,4,Worth the Hype,,"This book? Definitely worth the hype. Let me give you three reasons why:1. This book has the BEST writer's/character's voice I've read in a while. I was completely sucked into January's life from the first sentence: ""I have a fatal flaw."" She's a totally relatable character, and even when she's not relatable, you can't help but watch the train wreck that's inevitably going to happen. She's clever, witty, salty, and she strikes a perfect balance of naivety and realism. Honestly, she's one of my favorite character I've had the pleasure of stalking. I didn't want to un-stalk her at any point.2. If you're looking for a new OTP, you need only pick up this book. I don't want to say too much, but the passionate tension between January and Gus is strong enough to exist off the page and make you remember their witty and sometimes-deep conversations when you're doing all the mundane things in your life. Also, the whole deal with them both being writers is something so fascinating to me, and them swapping genres for the summer and teaching each other about their genre tropes made my writing-nerd heart sing. I can't say enough about January and Gus (besides the fact that I still feel like their names belong in some YA romance novel that involves cancer or another life-threatening disease).3. If my number two reason didn't cook your grits, this one better. This book isn't just about romance. Obviously there's other plot-lines, but get this: they are interesting plot lines not because unique and crazy things happen but because January seems like a real person, and you want to be involved in every detail of her life. Her character growth (and Gus's, actually) is incredible.These three reasons should be enough to encourage you to pick up the book, especially if you already like romances and reading about angsty writers who live somewhat solitary lives. It's a perfectly lovely book that dives deeper than just romance, and really makes you wonder if you're the optimist or the pessimist in life. I promise, it's enjoyable to read this book.(Some may wonder why I'm not giving it five stars. It takes an incredible contemporary/romance/non-fantasy to make me give something five stars. While I really enjoyed this book, I can't imagine I'd read it again anytime soon, and it didn't make me feel as much as I wanted to. It's just an incredibly good book. Hence the longest review I've ever written.)Writing Aesthetic/Style: 4Plot/Movement: 4Character Development: 5Overall: 4Thank you Berkley Publishing and NetGalley for the review copy!",FALSE,romance,1,1,
2612,1982185821,5,"Honest, reflective, and healing",4 people found this helpful,"I listened to the audiobook version of this, which is narrated by Jennette. Personally, I love memoirs especially from celebrities, and this is no different. I was a huge iCarly fan growing up, and while I never got into or really watched Sam & Cat, I've been a fan of Jennette. This was so beautifully written and the awareness that Jennette has about certain things (and later on after some guidance) is remarkable. You truly never know what happens behind closed doors, and social media/media in general is fake, and this is proof of that. It's truly sad to hear about everything she went through to get to where she is now, but I am so happy for her that she made it. Cheers to her, and fingers crossed this book makes her more money than she ever could've and did earn in her acting career.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,1,1,

I no longer had the time and the idea of dedicating my little free time to even more reading made no sense to me and filled me with dread. I'm now a recent college graduate and this is the first book I've read in my free time in years. I tore through it in four days, and it would've been less had I not been working.Jennette is an incredibly skilled writer. She has a command over words that is gimmick-less and true. She simply writes things they way they are and the way she sees them, and it is incredibly striking. She writes of events in her life that resonated deeply and miserably with me, and events that struck me with horrified, disgusted awe--behaviors so unimaginable that it horrifies me this came from a place of reality. Needless to say, I was often in tears reading this.[Mild and non-specific spoilers below.]Towards the end, I was crying because of just how proud of Jennette I was. Reading of her finally craving a grip on her life, creating a healthier relationship with control, developing boundaries, regaining herself--it all struck me with an intense sense of joy and sheer pride. I can only imagine the strength this journey took--not just writing the book, but reliving the memories, and all of the processing and recovery that came before it.I'm left wanting more. What I'm personally interested in (and what have loved to read) was an expansion on how she came to terms with her mother being abusive. I don't imagine her revisiting this topic in a book, though, so perhaps I'll look to interviews. Regardless, I look greatly forward to whatever she puts out next. I am certain she will make it magic.Overall, a fantastic read for those who can stomach the intense, vivid, and plainly-stated.
