It was never obvious who the guilty party would be, or even exactly how the crime played out, until very near the end. Even then there were a few twists as the loose ends were wrapped up. Some readers might find the regular jumping from one of the many characters' point of view to another distracting, but for me it added to the mystery as various viewpoints and self perceptions emerged; and was essential to the theme of everyone involved having their own secrets and bearing some sense of guilt, whether deserved or not.",True,mystery,1

I finished Beach Read in a day so I like that it was a quick read. Everything else, I wasn't a fan of. I would have liked it better without all the constant ""getting to know one another talk"" that was supposed to be deep and full of feelings because life is messy and blah blah blah. The concept of two different genre writers that make a bet and fall in love with one another sounds so much better than two writers who don't know how to use words in the actual English language to effectively communicate and just assume they know what the other is thinking all the time but they don't actually know and are wrong 100% of the time because they are both sad and scared individuals.SPOILER:They were in love with one another before the book even started so you don't get to organically read that even happen because there is no ""meet cute"" since they have already met and teased sexual feelings for one another before.

25,451524934,5,1984 and my childhood,6 people found this helpful,"Mindlessly mechanical, very few things move her emotionally. ""Things will be all right for future generations,"" she tells my father. She has no need for family history, her own or mine. She fears creativity until recently. My mother, a misanthrope who grew up under communist China's educational system, even after residing in the States for more than twenty-five years, cannot seem to snap out of her past ""education"" by the communists. In my memory, she seems to hold little joy in her life. What a novel 1984 is; it sheds light on my questions: ""Who is my mother?"" and ""What is my mother?"" In a sense, ""Chapter One"" of the Book rings a personal truth to my upbringing, so many things that my mother said to me about the world, during my childhood, puzzled me. Whatever psychological lessons my mother went through during her ""education,"" I doubt she'd ever share it with me. Nonetheless, I would not be surprised if she received training in doubletalk, doublethink and the indoctrination ""freedom is slavery."" It was very easy, almost too easy, for me to project myself into the novel, because it felt so personal and real.So it was easy for me to imagine myself living in a Totalitarian society, but it would be too much of a nightmare, for I already have a slight taste of it in my childhood. Unknowingly, in the past few years, I have worked in my small ways to strengthen my knowledge and belief in a democratic society, may it be researching history, studying the structure of mainstream media, or becoming more aware and decoding the means of deception and misinformation, which is so pertinent to understand the actions of current Bush administration.Even though the main character, Winston Smith, in 1984 eventually learned to love the Big Brother after forty years, I am still optimistic about meeting my responsibility as a US citizen, participating in quasi-democracy and reading once more 1984 as a novel, not a history book. But, if it ever becomes truly historical in content, by then, 1984 would have been either re-written or George Orwell vaporized out of existence.",True,humor_entertainment,1

Driscoll takes the time to develop the major characters in the various roles they play, not only as a person affected by the crime, but also as a mother, witness, friend, associate, father, and sibling.  Each chapter is labeled by the character's role in the story, pulling the reader into a relationship with that character such that the reader can empathize more readily with the character's emotions.  There are good twists and turns as the story progresses and no explicit sex or overly violent content.  It was hard for me to put down.

It is not quite accurate to say that I re-read it, as I could not finish the book before, could not make it through the torture scene many years ago. Now, for the first time, I have read the book entire.I am glad I did. I no longer view it as a frightening vision, as I consider the scenario depicted impossible. I view the work as an indictment of the Soviet Union employing the satirist's tactic of exaggeration to heighten the critique. By envisioning a world even worse than the USSR, increasing its horrors in every area and manner, Orwell managed to rebut the Union's liberal apologists too timid to condemn Stalin, afraid doing so would discredit socialism. His master stroke was in setting the system in England, showing the World what such a system would look like in the ""Western"" world, not someplace foreign to his target audience. Orwell forced English and American readers to confront the awful possibility, to face the harsh facts of such a system that they might not welcome it but work to prevent it.Now I find *1984* enjoyable, particularly Julia and O'Brien.

The vibrant, noisy, entirely wonderful Petropolous family lived next door, and Macy and Elliot became instant friends. Over the years, their friendship slowly became more. Elliot became Macy’s first kiss. Her first love. Her first time. Then, in one horrific weekend, Macy’s life is ripped to shreds.Ten years later, she’s a resident in critical care pediatrics. She’s engaged to an older man. She has a couple close friends, but she’s never really let anybody new into her life. Not for real, and not after what happened with Elliot. And then she sees him. It’s a total coincidence, and it completely shakes up her life. With Elliot back in her life, Macy must revisit those painful memories and determine for herself whether she’s truly satisfied with the way things turned out.Wow. Just... wow.

I went to HS and college during the Cold War and books like 1984, Animal Farm, and Brave New World were required reading, but not Fahrenheit 451.  The language is a bit flowery for me, but seemed to become more efficient as the story unfolded.  I actually got chills at times.  The wall-to-wall televisors mentioned were meant to represent mind numbing, distracting televisions, but they could just as easily represent social media in the 21st century.  Although not a thriller, there is enough suspense to keep readers interested.  Unfortunately, like the other books of this period and genre, it is becoming less of a work of fiction and more of a pre-telling of a fast-approaching future if society continues to let itself be dumbed down and distracted while money, power, and control is further concentrated into the hands of the ruling elites.",True,humor_entertainment,1

Also humor, and a diverse cast of both lead and supporting characters.What kept me from loving it: certain things seemed a little unrealistic, like one of the characters inviting a man up to her apartment, despite having second thoughts about it, on a first casual date. I can't really see a single woman doing that in this day and age. I wouldn't. Some things were a little too convenient, and some of the humor felt a little cheesy.

2222,1451673310,4,There is more to just the burning of books in Fahrenheit 451,,"This book is way ahead of its time when it comes to technology and society.The book, Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury was published in 1953, while the setting takes place in the year 2026. That means that this book was written almost 70 years ago and he tried to predict what will happen in the future.In this book, it is set in a society where the firemen are not people who put out fires, but instead set fires. Owning books is seen as a crime and if you are caught with one or more you will be arrested and they will burn those books. The main character, who is a fireman, eventually gets hold of some books and is able to gain knowledge from them, which causes him to see differently from others. Since he broke the law by reading books he is hunted and chased by the police.I think that one of the main themes in this book revolves around censorship and not allowing people to express their ideas. Books have the ability to give people knowledge and raise their intelligence. They are one of the best ways to expand your thinking and improve many aspects in one’s life. So when the plot in the story outlaws books it does not allow the people to question and think. Sometimes people don’t like when they share their opinion because it may cause others to feel offended. So removing one of the main sources of knowledge prevents others from being offended by someone else’s opinion.Although this was more of a shorter book, it is still a great book to read over and over until you get the messages hidden within the lines.",True,humor_entertainment,1

I am always drawn to a good romcom book, but my number one book pet peeve is when a simple miscommunication becomes the catalyst that breaks the happy couple up. Please, for the love of all things- just clarify before you blow up your relationship! While this book followed the normal enemies to lovers plot it had a little more depth to it in terms of what came between their relationship and that was a big highlight for me. I also really liked how they sort of delved into how our family growing up shapes our views of relationships going forward. My husband and I had polar opposite upbringings and there may have been some transference onto the characters on my part.

I was annoyed by that because the whole thing was based around Lily and her relationship with Ryle, but there wasn't an ""end goal."" But at the same time, I understand that this book was more about Lily's relationships rather than a career goal or future goal of hers so I'll let it slide.I'm so mad that I spent 70% of this book loving Ryle and not getting to know Atlas. Like, I hate that for me. Sorta related, I love and hate CoHo for making me love Ryle and then promptly giving me so many mixed emotions. It made helped me to relate to Lily better and her predicament. The author's note at the end also helped me to understand why CoHo wrote things the ways she did and why she couldn't just let Ryle be the good guy. And like, yeah...okay. I'm mad about it but also not.Thank goodness there is going to be a book 2 because I really wanna get to know Atlas. He gave too many great quotes and was too nice of a guy to not get more of a story.Overall, this book was raw and real.

For the most part, the book is conflict-free and very straight forward (girl and boy meet cute, hit it off, go on a series of dates, fall in love), but i still found it super enjoyable, probably because the characters were well written and relatable and I breezed through this one in about 2 hours.",False,romance,0

Guy Montag accepts this society till he meets a young girl who makes him think on his role and the society as a whole. we can see more of this idea of censorship in many places today an example might be china censoring everything against the government or even the USA banning certain books that they think lead people to rebel against the government ""the House on Mango Street"" is a large example of this as it is banned from being taught to kids in school in many states. overall anyone who hasn't been taken over by the mass media like TV or video games and has a good since of symbolism would love this book.",True,humor_entertainment,1

2005,1451673310,5,"It's a wonderful book, written in Bradbury's familiar",2 people found this helpful,"If you haven't read Fahrenheit 451, now's the time. It's a wonderful book, written in Bradbury's familiar, breathless prose; most of the characters speak in rapid-fire, axiomatic bursts.The novel takes place in an imagined future in which books are illegal, and, because houses are fireproof, firefighters are charged with setting fires, rather than putting them out; they burn all illicit materials, anything that might stir the emotions; things that might, so the thinking goes, incite people to revolt, or to think.Everything changes when the protagonist, a faithful fireman named Guy Montag, begins to wonder what motivates the few ""anarchists"" who cling to their books, who stuff copies of the Bible and Melville into their sofas and hide Milton or Salinger in their jackets. This begins Guy's quest to discover whether reading, and the uncertainty and swings of emotion it engenders, is really so horrible as he's been told.Today's reader might think the premise tired; the totalitarian future under an oppressive system is something we've seen done many times. But this book came out in a time when that wasn't true; it was pioneering in its vision, and so much of what has followed owes a debt to Bradbury. And so, to understand the heritage of those stories, this book is valuable. But beyond its historical significance, this book is a delight to read by virtue of the sheer joy of its prose. Bradbury's motto was an energetic cry of ""Live Forever!"" and that same hunger for life in all its richness crackles in his writing. This book reminds you what it's like to feel rain on your face, and what it's like to be moved by poetry. In the midst of the noise and busyness of contemporary life, Bradbury ever beckons us to stop and smell the roses, before they're all burned up or paved over.",True,humor_entertainment,1

It made me laugh out loud and one part even made me cry. And since it’s a romance even made me blush a couple times! It is so well written that you are cheering on the characters along the way.🙌💛..The story takes place in the past and present. Macy and Elliot meet as teenagers and become best friends and first loves. But in present day you learn they have not seen each other nor been in contact in a decade. As the story unfolds you learn about their families and pasts growing up together. This deep dive into their past explains what happened. As they are basically meeting each all over again as adults the past and present twist together to produce such a great story. You will want to keep reading to see what happens.

5574,670062510,5,A Gripping Tale,6 people found this helpful,"""The Outsider"" is a growing up tale by the wunderkind S.E. Hinton (she wrote the novel when she was still in high school).  In a small town two gangs are divided along class lines.  The greasers come from abusive and broken families, and they fight against a society that hates them as a way to identify themselves.  The Socs come from success-driven and wealthy families, and they like to beat up greasers for kicks.  But a common adolescent angst and need for belonging unite both groups in a common frail humanity, and it's the frailness and vulnerability of all the characters that make this book such a compelling read.The narrator is fourteen-year-old Ponyboy, a greaser who's precariously straddling two worlds.  Ponyboy's smart and articulate and loves to read, and though his parents are gone he's protected by two older brothers who will fight to the death to ensure a better life for their youngest sibling.  If he keeps his head low then eventually he'll make it into the world of the Socs, which is where his eldest brother belongs (but isn't because he's so busy taking care of Ponyboy).  But Ponyboy's loyal and emotional, and his best friends are the underachieving greasers, and it's Ponyboy's struggle to achieve an individual identity that is the central underlying tension in this book.What makes this book ultimately work is Ponyboy's smooth elegant diction, which betrays a sensitivity and vulnerability, but also thoughtfulness and ambition.  In her first book, SE Hinton displays the same powerful empathy and wisdom that Carson McCullers displayed in ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.""",True,children,1

2224,1451673310,4,An easy read with much beneath the surface...,One person found this helpful,"While a good read with strong themes, I struggle to grasp why this book is considered such a ""classic"" by so many.  I'll admit - I am no one to judge what a ""classic"" is, but it would be nice if someone could explain it to me - as there are other books out there that drive at similar points but are considered far less noteworthy.That being said, there were some strong themes running through this book that seem very prophetic - the book was written in the 1950s, and I caught myself more than once drawing on Bradbury's ""exaggerations"" (at the time) to current society.  Such as the mass media (or propaganda) and mind control - crippling people's ability to think for themselves - and in fact doing the ""thinking"" for them.  This is a central theme and one of the reasons behind the burning of books - as books make you think and loosen one's ability to control.  And similarly, the (television) media's creation of short attention spans (immediately looking for the climax of a story - otherwise attention drifts) - creating a society that shallowly drifts from one climax to another, without every really grabbing a hold of anything.  Senses have been dulled to the point where no one actually sees anything - to the point that it's suggested that society wouldn't know what grass or flowers were - only if you showed them a green blur would the recognize grass (as they are so busy driving fast to get to their next ""climax"" they don't see anything else).  Both of these create a mindless society that lacks anything beneath the surface.  Bradbury displays the deterioration this causes with the Mildred character - Montag's numb wife whose only satisfaction is her television ""family"", and who presents a shallow façade of happiness - but who in reality is miserable (poignantly displayed when she attempts to kill herself towards the beginning of the novel).  I think she represents society in general - what Montag is ""supposed"" to be but is breaking free from.Although interpreted to be exaggerations at the time - one can link these ideas to current society (in the 2000s).  The ever shrinking attention span as technology develops new and newer media outlets (television, video games, Internet, iPods - all moving us further away from books).  The mindless shows and distractions we watch to help us escape from our own lives (I don't mean to sound like I'm on a high horse here - I do the same thing); the mind control of masses by spin networks and political twisting.  One reviewer mentioned the absurdity of intellectuals being banished to the far forest outside the city (in the book) - but what angle do you think ""political strategists"" are playing when they label President Obama an elitist, or rave about the liberal academia?  The tension between knowledge and ignorance was one of the main reasons for the banishment of books in the book.  I'm not suggesting that book burning is around the corner - only that the seeds that seem to have created Bradbury's fictional society are the same seeds that are present today.Overall - as mentioned a good book - and one that continues to grow on me (perhaps it is a classic after all?).",True,humor_entertainment,1

This was a joy to read, from the first page to the last. Both of Jasmine’s books have been so intelligently, beautifully, and masterfully crafted.The Proposal is an ownvoices novel that follows a woman who is completely blindsided by a marriage proposal at Dodger Stadium. Yet, before the camera crews come in to make a terrible situation even worse, she is saved by a stranger in the stands, and his sister.➽ Nikole Paterson - Black, freelance journalist, and the woman who just got surprise proposed to after only five months of dating her partner.➽ Carlos Ibarra - Latino, pediatrician, the stranger in the stands that we already were introduced to in The Wedding Date.And we get to see these two build a friendship, and maybe something more, after everything went down at Dodger Stadium. Neither one of them are at a point in their life where they are willing to start something new, but they have each other’s backs and prove that they are there for one another.Don’t get me wrong, I love Nik and Carlos with my whole heart, but Nik’s friends almost stole the show for me in this novel. Dana is an actress, black, and a lesbian, and has the freakin’ cutest f/f side romance ever. Like, please, I need a full-length novel right this second. And Courtney is a cupcake shop owner, Asian, and plus sized. And I think I had a smile from ear-to-ear every time she was on the page. Seriously, Nik, Dana, and Courtney are the definition of friendship goals and it was a joy to read.But probably my favorite thing in this book were the seamlessly woven important themes. There was also such a subtle, yet loud, message about how easy it is to not realize you are in an emotionally abusive relationship. And sometimes you don’t start to realize until you are completely secluded from your friends and family. Yet, it also shows that there always can be ways out, even if you have to wait a while, and that it is never too late once you realize when someone is being abusive.There was also such a beautiful discussion about how important it is to reclaim your safety after you have been violated or felt that it was threatened. Throughout this story, we see Nik take those steps, and it just meant a lot to me, personally. I also loved how she had friends helping along the way.The reason I did end up giving this four stars, and not five, was because I felt like Carlos acted a little questionably at the end. Trust me, it pains me to say, because I do love him so much. Yet, with the way he and Nik met, you would think that he would understand how she would react to a (quicker) repeat. I’m trying to be vague, but his actions just left me side-eyeing a little at the end, and just dampened my enjoyment overall.Yet, I still loved this book, and I think Jasmine Guillory is such an impressive author. I can’t wait to read any and everything she writes. The romance world just needs more books like The Proposal and The Wedding Date! I completely recommend this one!",False,romance,1

15542,1984806734,2,Not entertaining -too emotionally heavy,2 people found this helpful,"I wanted to love this book and be entertained by a lightweight read. Too bad that both characters (he and she) had some fairly ordinary bad life experiences -- her father unfaithful to her mother -- his father really abusive. So how do those backgrounds and emotional baggage make this a Beach Read? Then there's the gloomy work that HE is doing to find out how cults work. Who cares? Go watch a TV documentary for that stuff -- not a romance novel. And its boring -- one thing I do is read on a tablet and can therefore track the percentages of pages read. I use this tool to find out if the writer is staying true to common, American novel, standards of internal story structure -- I know that's nerdy. BUT we want our sentence structures to conform to American English standards, and I want my story telling to conform to standard American novel standards.This book, Beach Reads, violates the common standards. For example, there's a movie term that describes common film standards: SEX AT SIXTY. Meaning that in a two-hour movie, lovers unit at the sixty minute mark.  Its also true of contemporary romance novels.  Romance readers have an expectation that lovers will unit somewhere around the middle of the book. Sadly, this book breezes past the key story turning point and thereby disappoints in terms of standard reader expectations. Which would not be too bad if there was some romance instead of all the weeping and wailing about the heavy emotional baggage of the lead characters.Add in the sadness of cult story..",False,romance,-1

16970,1501128019,2,Missed the mark,2 people found this helpful,"Unpopular opinion alert: I didn’t think it was possible for me to not like a Christina Lauren book. I’ve been turning it around in my mind for months to pinpoint what went wrong because I am definitely in the minority opinion here.This is being marketed as Women’s Fiction but it read as a less steamy version of their contemporary romances. I wanted there to be more to the story but really it centered around whether Elliot and Macy would get back together. Totally fine it was a romance but I struggled to see where Women’s Fiction fit as the genre.Then there was the representation of San Francisco. If you’ve never lived there, then the way the city was depicted probably didn’t stand out to you. While I was pleased to see one of my favorite restaurants Nopalito featured, there was so much about city and Bay Area life that was wrong and it was so distracting and definitely impacted my enjoyment of the book. No way could someone have found parking close to Golden Gate Park on a Saturday at noon! It’s the most diverse city I’ve ever lived in but the San Francisco we see here is Very White. Or is it?Sometimes culture is alluded to but more often then not, there was a complete lack of description for character’s cultural background. Macy doesn’t even mention her “South American” blood or having dark skin until about 25% in. Her fiancé might be Asian American because his last name is Chen but there’s no real description of him or his daughter. Representation is so important, especially in urban settings, and this missed the mark.But what really bothered me was how emotionally manipulative the story turned out to be. The whole time we’re waiting for Macy and Elliot to deal with whatever happened in their past to drive them apart. When we learn the truth, I could not believe the events actually went down that way or understand why these two hadn’t dealt with it from the moment they decided they were going to try to be friends again.I’m really glad for other readers who enjoyed this story but it didn’t work for me. But by no means am I done with Christina Lauren books. I’ll be the first in line for their next contemporary romance or YA offering! They’re a talented writing team and I look forward to seeing what’s next.Disclosure: I received an advance copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.",False,romance,-1

15949,1984806734,4,Fun yet serious.,,"At the end of Beach Read, Emily Henry wrote a section she called “Reader's Guide: Behind the Book.” In it, she said if she's describing this book to someone who is not a writer she says it's about “a disillusioned romance author and a literary fiction writer who make a deal to swap genres for the summer.” She then says if she's talking to a writer she says it's a book “about writer's block.” I didn't find the writer's block discussions and the pressure from her agent to be particularly interesting. However, the concept of the difficulties with writing the two different genres was fascinating. I believe it is the best part of this book.The basic storyline of Beach Read is that a woman, January Andrews, who just lost her father discovers that he had a second life with a mistress with whom he shared a house on Lake Michigan. January's father has left the house to her. She goes to this beach house to find a place where she can concentrate on her writing. She is being pressured by her agent to produce a book over the summer and she is having trouble getting started.January did not know about her father's affair but learns that her mother knew everything. Every time she asks her mother about the affair her mother says, “I don't want to talk about it.” So January is shocked and confused by her father's death, his affair, the way her mother allowed their life to go on without any changes, and how she has now inherited a place she didn't even know existed. Combine all this with the fact that January ends up living next door to Augustus Everett, someone she knew in college, which is, of course, a setup for romance.The book is a fun read as the two writers get to know each other and rehash their feelings about misunderstandings they had years ago.

5585,670062510,5,I gave it this score because it had a great theme and a great plot,One person found this helpful,"In my opinion the book The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton deserves a solid 8.7/10. I gave it this score because it had a great theme and a great plot. Why it’s not a 9 or 10 is because there were some slow parts in the realistic fiction novel. In general the book was filled with juicy word choice and intriguing ideas. It was just easy to get pulled away from the book when it got very slow. “The cinders and embers began falling on us, stinging and smarting like ants. Suddenly, in the red glow and the haze, I remembered wondering what it was like in a burning ember, and I thought: Now I know, it’s a red hell” (pg. 126-127). This sentences shows the kind of detail Hilton adds to her writing. Sentences like this are what bring you back fm boredom and engage you with the book again.I could connect to the book in a couple of ways. At the beginning of the story Hilton mentions a lot how the Greasers are such a tight nit group. That reminds me a lot of my friend group. We walk around the neighborhood like we own the place always getting hurt and just having fun with what we have. It was super cool to see how similar our group was to theirs.Personally I believe that S. E. Hilton did an exceptional job on the book and I highly recommend it. If I had to assign it to a certain group of people I would probably tell ages 13-16 to read it. Those are good ages to read it because they are close ages to the main character, Ponyboy. What you can connect to the character it makes thing much more interesting. All in all a great book.",True,children,1

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. The book tells us about the rivalry between two gangs and the type of life that some of the members face. The characters have some struggles throughout the book, but they also have some good moments with each other. This book kept me very interested and intrigued. I loved reading it and I would definitely read it again. Overall, I would rate The Outsiders a 9/10.",True,children,1

It's a romance with two very endearing characters who struggle not to fall in love even as they are falling in love.  At first, they think they are enemies but the more time they spend together, the more it's just the opposite.January is a romance writer in a writing slump.  She has been betrayed by her father and (she feels) ignored by her mother.  Her father left her a beach house on Lake Michigan so she is convinced she can write her next book - which is due very soon - while she has the peace and quiet.  Augustus in a popular novelist of literary fiction.  He too is in a writing slump and trying to get his next book written.  He lives in the beach cottage next to January.  At first they make fun of the genres that the other writes.  Augustus doesn't feel that books with a happy ending are very realistic because life doesn't always have happy endings.  January feels like literary fiction is usually bleak and unhappy.  They make a deal -- during the summer, January will write a book of literary fiction and Augustus will write a romance.  To help them along, every Friday Gus will take her to do research to write literary fiction and every Saturday, she will take him to do something that could show up in a romance novel.  When they start to spend more time together, their feelings for each other begin to change but there's still a lot of baggage that needs to be settled before they can have a relationship.Beach Read is more than just a light fluffy romance.  I enjoyed both of the main characters and what they went through after they switched genres.

2235,1451673310,5,"""SHOW DON'T TELL"" AT ITS BEST!",,"I’m somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had never read this book back in my school days, but I sure am glad I’ve read it now. In my view, it has completely reversed my attitude toward “science fiction” which I had always mentally dismissed as a fantasy genre about, mainly, Martians. This book opened wide my eyes to experience what Bradbury himself referred to as “speculative fiction.” I found it wildly imaginative, prophetic, and poetic.Reading this was like dreaming a nightmare in which things are upside-down and/or inside-out. Books, for example, are designated “enemies of the state” because they cause people to think, and thinking leads to unhappiness -- and in the crazy “fun house” of this wildly imaginated world, happiness is their utmost goal.But life inside this “fun house” is no fun at all. Citizens here live literally surrounded by televised soap operas displayed life-size: on walls (whole walls!) – the three walls of a room. They live their lives vicariously watching and hoping for a fourth wall to complete the room. When not watching the walls, they use ear buds and tune into whatever is being piped into them from the powers-that-be. Their attentions thus focused and diverted, the people become numbed down and dumbed down. Eventually, many seem catatonic; others are suicidal, and dozens attempt suicide daily with dozens more succeeding.Another “nightmare inversion” is the Fire Department that is never sent to extinguish a conflagration, but instead, to set a specific home ON fire. Their mission is to extinguish all the books before literature leads people to question the status quo. Ergo the fire-fighters in reverse, along with their faithful hound who is not a Dalmatian but a programmed computer in the shape of a dog who hunts down all dissenters and kills each one by injection.There are, of course, dissenters who manage to escape the unexamined lifestyle and share the task of memorizing the best of books even as they burn into ashes. They are like old-fashioned hobos, a remnant, dedicated to keeping wisdom alive as they evade the horrible hound hunting with its syringe until the end of its world.This book is “show don’t tell” at its best. Ray Bradbury found a way to say what he believed without preaching: SHOWING that a person truly exists only when exercising all senses and exerting all faculties. One reviewer called this book a “Mene, mene, tekel of things to come.” Years later, Marshall McLuhan began warning that the media is the message that can shape people and produce a placid, non-questioning, passive populace. But Bradbury beat him to it. He even had the syringe.",True,humor_entertainment,1

In some ways I connected with January as we both lost our father's and how loss can really affect us emotionally. Emily did a great job with it all.Even after finishing the book, I had such a book hangover that I had to reread it again! While you expect from the title that it will be a beach read, light, rom-com about two authors who write the opposite of what they are used to, but the entire premise was perfect. I loved January and Augustus immediately and enjoyed all the humour and how their relationship grew from friends to more. Beach Read is officially one of my favourite books of the year and the writing was captivating from the beginning to end. I already wish I had her next book! I really enjoyed getting to see that these characters are so relatable. The book overall is a must read!

Plus, she was apparently a beautiful woman, so it didn't quite make sense for her to be in such a low space self-esteem wise🤷🏾‍♀️. I like that, even without her being aware, that she really cared for Carlos and helped him to be more open and relaxed with her.I loved Carlos from the previous book, so I was glad he was even more likable and charming in this one. Who sees a woman in distress and want to 'save' or help her the way he did? Not many that I know. I like that he wanted to take care of his family and ensure that his father's absence wasn't too much for everyone, yet it was costing him a lot more than he was willing to admit. I'm glad he opened up to Nik and she encouraged him to go to the doctor and talk to his sister, Angela.Nik and Carlos were a match from the beginning and I loved their easy going, casual, way of being together, even though they tried hard to deny the connection.I wasn't too crazy about Niks' friends, Dana and Courtney. I like that they all had a sister-like bond, yet that's about it.This series is so quick and easy and light and fun and I am really enjoying all of the characters for the most part.Now that I'm caught up, I can move on to book 4 (I read these all out of order🤦🏾‍♀️).

The plot, characters, and dialogue were all what Hallmark movies should be but aren't.  The plot was minimal but interesting, the characters were believable and intriguing, and the dialogue was clever and engaging.Unfortunately, about two-thirds of the way through, the book shifted gears with a crunch; apparently, the author decided she had to get more serious.  The tone and content both changed, and the lead character became way too analytical about her own and Gus' feelings and actions.  The two of them became improbable, much less believable, and much less able to draw me into the story.  Their dialogue (both internal and audible) was way too self-consciously profound to an extent that I could no longer imagine anyone every really talking (or thinking) that way.  At least not without a lifetime of Freudian analysis, something they were both too young to have experienced.This is a good read despite the weakness of the last third, though, so I gave it three stars.

115,451524934,5,Strikingly Prescient of 2013,2 people found this helpful,"A powerful novel written in 1949 about one man's view and experience from inside a dystopian society where the government spies on its citizens continuously to stifle dissent, maintains the citizens in a state of constant fear by fabricating enemies and wars and tortures it's citizens when they're found to have incorrect thinking.  George Orwell's haunting examination of the natural inclination to resist regimented control by all-powerful authority figures, the desire to experience closeness and intimacy with another human (an act forbidden in this controlled society) with the recognition of the inevitable discovery and destruction by the state is a disturbing look at the inside of a totalitarian society.  Unfortunately, it appears that this is the direction in which Western, so-called democratic and free countries are heading.  The real eye-opener is the admission by the state rulers (and torturers) that perpetuating this living hell of a society was solely to accumulate and maintain ever-increasing amounts of power.  This is a clear-eyed view of the psychopaths (like Stalin, Hitler and, quite possibly, our current governments in the West) who gain power and manipulate the system in every way possible to strive for ultimate power, with no recognition of the cost to other's lives.  This book should be on everyone's reading list as a cautionary tale about how democratic countries can be hijacked by psychopathic rulers for their own selfish accumulation of power and how fragile freedom and liberty is.",True,humor_entertainment,1

I feel almost like she's a childhood friend and I am so happy and excited every time she writes a new book.I love it when writers write about writing, even if it's through their characters. Beach Read gave us two very different writers, but both with their own love and appreciation of the art. And paralyzing writers block. Henry weaves some really great comments and descriptions of writing and reading into these character's personalities, whether they are her own thoughts or not, and I loved being able to bond with them over my own love of writing.This book felt like a hipster beach read, which I suppose is what it was supposed to be, at least on the surface. There are trendy pop cultural references and Juno-like conversations. But somewhere in the middle, the feel starts to shift and the puffy pink romance gets a bit deeper and a bit darker, asking a lot of the characters as they self examine and try to sort out their messy lives and a boatload of complicated feelings that stem beyond the romance in front of them. Or more specifically, next door.I'm not one to read books that can be described as steamy, but I'm lacking for any other word that could sum up the romantic part of this. I was expecting the romance, thought it would be more of the rom-com type, but boy does Henry know how to write a brooding, sultry love story and it seeped past my cold exterior, filling me with some kind of warmth. This was the kind of book that I didn’t want to end, the kind of book where I’m rooting for a happy ending.I have read all of Henry's books and there is a noticeable progression in her work; she seems to always write about love and family, usually in an uplifting and light air, but with every new book, she is stretching those themes in different directions, exploring different approaches. Sure, that means that maybe not every book will hit me quite like her first did, but it also makes me feel like I am discovering a new talented storyteller every time I see her name and I love that.",True,romance,1

Elliot and Macy meet as children when Macy and her dad buy a vacation home next door to Elliot's home.  They bond over their love of books and reading.This story switches back from present to past.  It is part suspense and part love story.  From 10 until 18 Elliot and Macy were friends and then lovers but 11 years ago something happened that separated them forever - until they accidentally meet one day.The reader knows something bad must have happened to break them up but you are left to wonder almost the whole book.

She goes up to live in it when she is broke and still is working on her current novel--or rather not working on it.  Her next door neighbor is Gus Everett, her rival in college.  After taking potshots at each other, they decide to have a contest where he writes a rom-com and she writes a literary novel and see which one can sell theirs first.  In the course of their writing, truths come out.I loved this book!  I loved January.  I could relate to her as she and Gus have their discussions at the end of their days of writing.  I understood her thoughts.  I also loved Gus.  He is similar to January but his thoughts took on a darker tone.  Once January can get him to open up, he reveals a lot to January--things she never expected.  I did appreciate their openness when their thoughts and explanations came out.  It is rare to have that much communication between characters.  His explanation when they went to New Eden was wonderful and swoon-worthy.I loved the other characters--Pete, Maggie, even Sonya.  They are quirky (not Sonya).  I was glad when Sonya made January listen to her.  So much was said and pain was let go eventually.  I wish January's mother had been more open with her earlier so her father's death would not have been a shock.I liked the humor.  There were times I was laughing out loud as I pictured these scenes.  The dialog was snappy and snarky (reminds me of the dialog in The Maltese Falcon).  This is one of the top books I have read this year.  It is wonderful watching a curmudgeon fall in love.",True,romance,1

9802,B08NLXR9V5,4,Brilliant Beginning to a new Series,,"A fabulous beginning to a new series that I enjoyed reading after Zoe Prime's editions. The protagonist, Ella Dark is an analyst with the FBI who aspires to work in the Behavioral crimes unit. Like Zoe Prime, she also has a unique skill of photographic memories of various serial killers in the country, their MO, type of victims they chose, and how the crimes were executed. Her dreams comes true when she is assigned in a triple homicide investigation in Louisiana under the expertise and mentoring of Agent Mia Ripley. These killings have left the local county police with no clues whatsoever. As Ella and Ripley visit each of the crime scenes, she is able to connect the dots that could link these murders to some past MO's of serial killers. While her instincts point in the direction of a copycat serial killer, she has to convince Ripley and the local sheriff to believe in her theory. As agent Ripley begins to believe in her analytical and behavioral analysis, the hunt for the assassin begins. There are quite a few twists and turns in the plot, suspense is well guarded until the climax and a roller coaster of action towards the end that grips the readers. The rookie-veteran duo character of Ella Dark and Mia Ripley is wonderfully dovetailed into the plot. Both Ella and the protagonist in the Zoe Prime series have a devastating past, but have a gifted ability to read through a killer's  mind which makes it thrilling read. Waiting for the release of Book 2 and 3 in the series.",True,mystery,1

Rest assured that this is it.  If you've played D&D, I'll just sum this up by saying that it definitely takes a turn back towards the old school style of role-playing.  The focus in how you play your character, not how you optimize his stats.  If you played 4th Edition, you know that it almost seems like a consolidation of D&D Miniatures and an MMO.  Well, not this.  This is about immersion in an imaginary world and escapism.  This is about creating truly memorable stories and people that you want to learn about.  It's exploration, lore, intrigue, mystery, peril, fantasy, and more.  If you're playing with a combat-centered group, 4th or 3.5 is probably more optimized for that.  5th is taking us back to that nerd heaven time period where we consumed Cheetos and Mountain Dew in our friend's mom's basement while talking in different voices and doing our best to stop laughing long enough to do something productive before the end of the night.

In this case, the nasty human tendency to elevate self above others is portrayed through the lives of barnyard pals after they awaken to their disadvantaged status vis-a-vis the farmer. Spoiler alert: the pigs ultimately co-opt the trust (and hard work) of their fellow barnyard pals in order to ""elevate"" themselves to a life of mean-spirited debauchery. But it's the description of how they get there that makes this an important, revelatory work. The role of small lies, the other animals' various tendencies that actively or passively enfranchise the pigs, and time itself churn out more misery than the farmer himself could ever have doled out, even as the eventual arbiter of their demise. The work shows us a host of all-too-familiar ""tactics,"" and how, under certain circumstances, they can form a totalizing narrative that no one can see their way out of.

2169,1451673310,2,"If reading literary ""classics,"" I recommend to skip this",2 people found this helpful,"For the past few years, I've been reading a lot of ""classics"" (everything from ancient epics/mythologies/Arthurian legend/Matter of France to Chaucer/Shakespeare to Kant/Hegel/Kierkegaard to the 19th-Century Russian novels to Borges, Joyce, Woolf, Kundera, etc.), so I approached this work from a very literary perspective and with a reasonably solid foundation in literature. That being said, I am not entirely sure why this is considered a modern ""masterpiece."" The concept is okay despite being derivative of earlier novels (of which, as has been said elsewhere, ""Brave New World"" and ""1984"" are prime examples, though I think he owes a fair amount to Kafka as well (and, given the relatively prevalent fear of totalitarianism/tyranny throughout history, probably many others as well)), but the execution is unexceptional to say--er, type--the least.I find the writing to be sophomoric and unpredictable: sometimes flowery metaphors or analogies are used without real purpose, and there are several unimpressive ""paradoxes"" (x is on fire yet x is also cold, y is living but y is also dead, etc.) producing the illusion of depth. What makes such rhetorical language so jarring, however, is that it is almost randomly thrown into an otherwise concise and straightforward narrative, as if Bradbury went back and tried ""spicing up"" his writing by thoughtlessly peppering it with unnecessary metaphors. (For example: early on, there is a paragraph discussing Mildred's eyes as ""moonstones,"" a poetical paragraph that was initially (for me) utterly confusing because it was totally unexpected and, considering the text within which it is couched, unfitting.) I can respect various registers and don't suscribe to New Criticism's imperative for self-contained organic harmony--I (eventually) loved ""Ulysses,"" which is neither consistent nor self-contained--but Bradbury's changes of style accomplish nothing but confusion, distraction, and perhaps an occasional ""how beautiful!"" from readers admiring a pretty but misplaced sentence.While the characters aren't developed with any depth, I can respect this decision: the protagonist becomes an ""everyman,"" the characters become symbols, the plot can unfold more rapidly, etc. Nonetheless, Bradbury is very heavy-handed with his symbolism and messages (even the ironic reversal of firefighters' duties is anything but subtle) and, despite the ""think for yourself"" message, it is almost as if Bradbury is a prophetic preacher telling you what to think. Thus, the novel lacks the nuanced depth of many great works of fiction. Likewise, the plot itself is presented sloppily and often seems contrived: a man who loves to watch books burn suddenly changes his entire outlook because of a few conversations with a teenager? (If the ""loving to watch books burn"" were written in free indirect discourse, then fine; Guy has hidden books in his house, slightly unsettled, but still *thinks* he likes burning books. But the narrative appears unilaterally third person limited.) Books must be burned, but there is no mention of paintings, movies, musical pieces, and other art/media, so what happened to those? How, exactly, did culture go from minorities/over-commodification/instant gratification to ""we must burn every bloody book, dammit!""? Moreover, the dialogue is not believable--it feels unnaturally fast, especially Guy's interactions with Faber--and it seems artificial, tailored to further the plot even at the expense of conversational logic.While not always disappointing, overall the writing gave me the impression that it was written by a smart and overeager high-schooler, not a literary master. The book has its audience, but those expecting/hoping to find a modern literary ""masterpiece"" will be sorely disappointed.",True,humor_entertainment,-1

It pulls you in and you just have to stay with it to the very end to see how it turns out for all the characters involved. It's not the happiest of tales at all times, but it's well written and keeps you interested all throughout.In this story there are two writers Augustus Everett who writes literary fiction, tends to keep his stories a bit more serious, and has no problem at all killing off his characters. Then there is January Andrews. A best selling romance writer who prefers happily ever after stories filled with love and romance (of course!). They are polar opposites. They find themselves living next to each other for three months in beach houses and after a bit of a rough start develop a friendship. As it goes on they decided to switch writing styles. She will write his style and he will write hers. As the story progresses they go on little trips that encompass their different styles in order for each to get a taste for the other side. They also learn a whole lot more about each other and things get pretty deep. This isn't a fluffy romance story so prepare for everything here.This is a decent story and one I recommend but realize it's not just fluff and fun. It does have a bit of a deeper story and it goes down some strange and sad avenues. It's deeper than just a beach read as the title suggests, though this would be great to be read at a beach just for the atmosphere especially if you are lucky enough to have a beach, a beach house, the smell of a beach, a picture of a beach to look at, etc. It's a good story so if your interest is peaked, go for it!",False,romance,0

15814,1984806734,4,Loved Beach Read! Cake & veggies in one in this pleasurable & deep story that will stay with you!,,"Beach Read is not your typical “Beach Read” as the name and delightful cover implies. It’s about two writers working through soul-crushing writer’s block, grief, betrayal and deciding to manage it all by switching things up and trying one another’s genres all while investigating a horrible suicide cult. Yes, suicide cult. There is a substantial depth to this book, as if you’re eating a really wonderful, sinfully delicious meal that is also somehow good for you. You get the cake and the veggies all in one.There are some excellent quips and monologues by the lead female author / character, January Andrews, who writes women’s fiction with happily ever afters (which is very meta and which I cannot quote as I read an advance copy) about women’s fiction and how it’s ridiculous that it’s a separate category from just plain FICTION because the person writing it happens to have different ""equipment"". I’m really, really paraphrasing. Emily Henry says it much more brilliantly.The lead male author/character, Augustus Everett is the same “Sexy Evil Gus” whom January went to college with and had a rather one-sided rivalry with. Gus writes dark, nihilistic novels with no happy ending in sight. At first they butt heads, they make assumptions about one another but gradually bond over their writing and writer’s block and the bet they make to trade genres: which of course means that Gus will have to write a romance with a happy ever after and January will have to write a “dark and brooding book”. January might not have a problem with that as she’s just had the worst year of her life.Eventually Gus and January get closer and Emily Henry becomes slightly obsessed with describing Gus’ dark eyes. I didn’t know there were that many ways to describe dark eyes. Now I do! Romance ensues! Swoon!It took me a while to write this review because I really wanted to marinate in the book a bit. I had a book hangover. Yes. It doesn’t get a solid five from me because the suicide cult was a little confusing and I’m not sure I truly understood why it was in the book at all. I would like to virtually attend a book club to discuss this. As well, I would really love to read the book January writes during the summer. Yes to the circus! I would definitely not want to read Gus’ book. I really loved this “Beach Read”. It gave me a lot of pleasure during a dark time in my life and in all of our lives.WRITING STYLE: 4/5PLOT: 4/5WORLD-BUILDING: 5/5CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 5/5ROMANCE: 3.5/5 (slow burn)HEAT: 3.5/5Many thanks to Edelweiss, Berkley and Emily Henry for an ARC in exchange for an honest book review of “Beach Read”.

I had no idea that I had a certain type of trope that I enjoyed. And that is second chance love tropes. And to be honest, I had no idea what the hell a trope was until the kind girl at Barnes and Noble told me. This was a feel good book, I giggled so much while reading this, and there were moments where I was screaming at the book because ""HELLO JANUARY!!! HOT GUY AT 5' O'CLOCK!!! STOP PLAYING HARD TO GET"" And while I connected with January on certain levels, Gus....he is my spirit animal. The pain and distrust from what his wife did to him, I know all too well. So when he struggled through his feelings for January, I felt that on a massive level. ⁣⁣What I enjoyed about Beach Read is that the characters were so well developed. And what I mean by that, is that they are so believably flawed in a way that is easily relatable. While this was considered a romance, it was a bit more serious than your lovey dovey kiss kiss romance which I greatly appreciated.

15759,1984806734,4,"I liked it, but I don't know if I would recommend it.",One person found this helpful,"3.5 stars.I finished this last night and decided to sleep on it before writing a review.  Is it a high C or a low B?  I'm saying low B - only because I can't quite put my finger on why it didn't work for me.  And in case anyone cares, the title is as misleading as the picture on the cover - neither of which has anything to do with the story within.January's life is in free fall.  After a mostly idyllic childhood, <i>aside from her mother's two bouts with cancer</i>, she's a published romance author in a committed relationship with a near perfect boyfriend.  She has great parents who love her, and each other.  Life is good.  She's happy, she thinks.  Ahem.Unfortunately, when <b>Beach Read</b> begins, it's been just under a year since the sudden death of January's beloved father.  The father who she belatedly discovered kept A LOT of secrets.  Secrets like his long term affair while married to her mother.  Secrets like the second home he sometimes shared with the other woman.  Secrets that her mother already knew.  And since meeting 'the other woman,' at her father's funeral - when the stranger pressed an envelope and key into her hands before fleeing - January is an emotional mess.Unable to talk to her mother about the affair, unable to write, unable to continue in her own 'perfect' relationship...her life is a shambles.  So she escapes to her father's beach home (oh, poor January) to try and put herself together.  Her sojourn gets off to a rocky start when she discovers her neighbor is none other than Augustus Everett, an acclaimed author of literary fiction.  The same Gus who was once her college nemesis/secret crush.  The same Gus who looked down on romantic fiction and January.  The same Gus who she shared one magical night with.So that's the set-up.  All good.  I like the friends to enemy trope, and Ms. Henry does an excellent job putting her principal characters into regular contact with one another.  Unfortunately, her characterization of these two never really gets much deeper than these essentials.  It's clear January wasn't the only one who once had a crush, and they're antagonistic early meetings are half hearted, at best.  Eventually we learn more about why Gus might have a slightly darker side - and that he has some pretty significant secrets of his own, but aside from their interactions with each other and with some of the stereotypical secondary characters (or, caricature's) that are always present in these little towns, these two mostly exist in a bubble of their own making.  Most of what we know about them is colored by their relationships with their parents, and their skewed memories of their college years.  I felt like I knew more about January's dad than I did about her - and the story is entirely told via her POV!Even though I felt her characters are underdeveloped, I enjoyed the snarky, funny, sharp dialogue between Gus and January, and it's a highlight of the novel.  Both characters love a good zinger, and I giggled a few times when they delivered a particularly excellent one.  These two have great chemistry, and the best parts of the story are definitely when they're together on the page.  The author, who I believe writes mostly YA, does an excellent job building the sexual tension...until we get to the actual sex scenes.  They're awkward, involve lots of January getting into Gus's lap (every time!), and are much too brief.  Perfunctory almost.  I was so excited for all that steam to combust in some juicy lovemaking, and when it doesn't, it's a major letdown.  Frankly, a fade to black might have been better.  Henry is all tease and zero delivery.But let me circle back a bit.  Gus and January wind up in each other's pockets after they challenge each other to write a novel in each other's preferred genre.  January uses Gus's research trips as a framework for her story, and - well, maybe it's a spoiler - Gus doesn't?  For most of the book, I assumed the climatic scene would include them realizing they were both writing the same story with different endings!  A story about themselves and their unfolding relationship!  Am I the only one who thought that?  Look, I think the books provided a great opportunity to delve deeper into how each of these character felt about what was developing between them, and instead they were just sort of meh revelations.  A missed opportunity for sure.<b>Beach Read</b> is an occasionally funny, sometimes steamy, mostly good rom-com.  It wasn't quite what I expected, and I didn't walk away from it with all the happy feels many of my friends expressed.  I still don't feel like January's complicated memories of her father are sufficiently resolved, and the ending is underwhelming.I liked it, but I don't know if I would recommend it.",False,romance,1

6,451524934,5,"The Ultimate Negative Utopia, Bar None",One person found this helpful,"Comparisons between Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR and Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD are so common in literary circles that they have become somewhat of a joke.  Especially when you consider that neither of these books was the first in the genre; while Huxley predated Orwell by seventeen years, somehow Zamyatin's WE, written a decade before BNW, often gets left out of the discussion (in fact it has been some time since I read WE, and I read two different translations, so I would need to tackle it again to review it properly).  And there are other novels in this genre that are worthy of consideration, such as Levin's THIS PERFECT DAY and Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451.  But at the end of the day, when it comes to the ultimate dystopia, it is Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR that emerges as the absolute expression of the genre in all its nightmarish vividness.London, 1984 (Or is it? Nothing is certain in this book).  We are introduced to Winston Smith, a clerical worker for the ruling body, an entity known only as ""the Party"" and represented by posters of a Stalin-like figure known only as ""Big Brother"" and the slogan ""Big Brother Is Watching You.""  Which is literally true:  everyone's apartment is equipped with a two-way television (""telescreen"") that sees and hears absolutely everything, from eating to sleep to sex, and which can be turned down but not off.Winston's job sums up the Party pretty well:  it is his task to process changes to newspapers, history books, magazines, any form of literature so that the present will match up with the past.  In short, it is his function to completely obliterate history on a daily basis.  The world is divided into three primary ""provinces:""  Oceania (in which London is located and which oddly appears to include the United States), Eurasia, and Eastasia.  There is always a war going on between Oceania and one of the other two, but it is subject to change on a dime, and when it does, Winston and his team must scramble to change all records to make them state that Oceania has ALWAYS been at war with whichever one happens to be the enemy at the moment.It is instructive that Winston performs his duties at a place called the Ministry of Truth, which is in fact dedicated to falsification of everything from history books to television shows.  There are two other Ministries:  The Ministry of Peace, which is concerned with war, and the Ministry of Love, which is concerned with horrors that I will not reveal here.Speaking of love, this is where comparisons with Huxley actually have some merit.  Both novels have removed all meaning from the sex act.  But Huxley does it by making promiscuity the order of the day and making any feelings deeper than the basic tactile sexual sensations deviant, unnatural, and anti-social.  Orwell does it by making sex a crime except for the necessity of procreation and in his world pleasure for the woman is the unnatural thing.  Winston has a wife (who left him some time earlier), but the descriptions of their couplings are bone-chilling:  a dedicated Party member, his wife hated sex but insisted that they do it once a week to make a baby, calling it (God help us all) ""Our duty to the Party.""  Winston's relief at her departure is almost palpable even though we only hear about it as a past event.Slogans abound in Orwell's world.  The three primary ones are WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH, all of which eerily recall the words that greeted the prisoners arriving at Auschwitz:  ARBECHT MACHT FREI (literally ""Work Makes One Free"" but more accurately ""Freedom Through Work"").Orwell does not limit his inspirations to Nazi Germany, though:  I have already mentioned the resemblance between the mythical ""Big Brother"" and Josef Stalin; his characters address each other as ""comrade"" and there is mention made on more than one occasion of work camps that sound more like Siberia than WWII Germany.Orwell was an unremitting pessimist.  The plot of his novel is so simple it is almost predictable:  Winston is an unhappy member of the Party, and unhappy people sooner or later do something rebellious.  Winston rebels, with a young woman named Julia, and there follows a brief period where things appear to be hopeful, but eventually the hammer falls, and the ending is almost preordained.Which brings us to the one other valid comparison to Huxley; in BNW, London is a city so sterile you could probably eat off the floors.  NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, on the other hand, is so grimy that you almost want to wash your hands after reading it.  The only other novel I can think of that presents the reader with such an unrelentingly gritty vision of the future is Harry Harrison's MAKE ROOM!  MAKE ROOM!, the inspiration for the film SOYLENT GREEN.There are a lot of futuristic dystopias out there, and they tend to share various features:  the genre is a narrow one, rather like horror and science fiction, and some crossover is inevitable.  But NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR stands out, somehow, above all the others; it has a grim resonance that is not only rather depressing but one gets the feeling that his vision is not in the least bit impossible and that we would do well to take care that we do not end up in Oceania.",True,humor_entertainment,1

1819,786965606,2,Ran a few campaigns; gave it a fair shake,7 people found this helpful,"While I am certainly glad that the 5th edition of the venerable Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game has brought in a lot of newcomers (and welcomed back old hands), that is unfortunately where my praise ends. This edition of the game represents, in my opinion, the weakest edition of the game released yet. Honestly, I would even prefer to play or run a game of 4th edition (which isn't actually too bad of a system) than to play 5th again. There are many, many problems with this edition, at least from the perspective of a role-player (vs. roll-player).This edition has to represent the most complicated and unfortunately least-accessible version of the game yet. While it's still not rocket science, new players are inundated with unnecessary amounts of minutiae. There is a heavy focus on ""min/maxing,"" the practice of fine-tuning during character creation to create as many mechanical and mathematical advantages as possible- not only does it allow this, but it encourages it through the offering-up of many feats and skills that apply all kinds of numerical bonuses. I understand some people like this, but I think the more that the game specifically says, ""here is what you can do,"" there is an implied ""and you cannot do anything else."" To the point that any conflict, physical or otherwise, comes down to picking a skill/ability and rolling. That leaves little room for player-driven creativity and improvisational acts. 5th edition tries to address the ""crunchiness"" of 3.x editions by throwing more variety into a system that, in my experience, discourages creative role-play in favor of rote and paint-by-numbers ability/skill checks. There is no *dynamism* in the system...everything is just-so and expected - it got to a point where nothing was surprising me from session-to-session. Every single encounter came down to the players picking a skill or ability to use; diplomacy here, bluff there, hide here, intimidate them, etc., with little to no flavor or personality...try as I might as a DM, the world we were trying to portray and animate just felt lifeless and flat.I also think that making it extremely difficult for player characters to die was a big mistake. Again, this is personal taste of course, but as someone that appreciates the sort of triumphant feeling that comes with surviving and thriving in a harsh and potentially lethal environment, this edition of D&D consistently, at every level tier, feels SAFE. Parties are given many options to circumvent the consequence of death, and they are given these at pretty early levels, too. This is probably my main issue with 5th edition...that encounters with monsters and enemies that should be extremely tense and carry the risk of death and ruin, are left just feeling bereft of actual lethality and threat. This is maybe a good thing for new players, but ultimately - after awhile - the players realize that they can be tactically sloppy and disorganized and still come through most encounters relatively unscathed. That is, to me, entirely antithetical to what the D&D experience is and should be about. I'm not some kind of DM that enjoys wiping a party, or tries to play the game as an adversarial one; I'm just a DM that uses all of the tools and resources available to try and animate these worlds and settings with some degree of realism, or verisimilitude. Having dangerous and potentially lethal encounters- in which the party might need to hide or even flee- was a way to bring the campaign to life and immerse us in it more fully. When you can have a party roam through your hexes, relatively confident in the fact that most, if not all, encounters will be tailor-made to suit their level and will not post any great threat to them...that does something to a campaign over time, and it really detracts from the idea of a living, breathing world that is being cooperatively explored and detailed as play progresses.As I mentioned, I am certainly thrilled at the prospect of more players coming into the hobby and I give credit to Wizards for that bit. But if you're someone that is keen on trying D&D - or even if you're currently playing in and thoroughly enjoying a 5E campaign - I would highly recommend checking out some of the older editions of the game or their simulacrums in the Old School Renaissance category. Both Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st and 2nd editions have solid mechanical foundations that give the group many tools for creating a rich and immersive role-playing experience that relies more on player/DM collaboration and cooperation than min/maxing and ""munchkin"" approaches. 2nd edition, especially, is a comparatively simple and intuitive system that is by its very nature the most modular and house-rules friendly version of the game; in the core books alone, the DM and players are given dozens of optional rules that can be experimented with and dropped in or out of a campaign. Throw in the Player's Options series and you can customize your AD&D game to such an extent that I've yet to see equaled in any published tabletop role-playing game. Even the original D&D rules (BECMI and B/X) have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity. Thanks to the simulacrum games like For Gold & Glory, Legends & Labyrinths, Swords & Wizardry, etc., many sourcebooks and expansions for these older editions of D&D are being published and put out there into the community.So whether you're brand new to the hobby or someone that has been playing since 3.x, I encourage you to at least give vintage editions of D&D a careful examination, as I suspect that for at least some of you, you'll find them to be mechanically accessible and rich with role-playing possibilities that enhance and encourage immersion. Many of these editions are available in print-on-demand from various online retailers, but you can also get the original books from here on Amazon for surprisingly cheap (at least for now). Approach it with an open mind and see what happens! Best of luck in your tabletop journeys!",True,humor_entertainment,-1

There is serious loss, which Macy definitely suffers, and then there is her inability to see, even as an adult, that Elliot was just behaving like a teenage boy at the age of 18--shocker. This book could have been powerful if CLo had framed it through the lens of visits to a therapist. It could have shown that they can write romantic drama like Alessandra Torre or Jasinda Wilder.

201,451524934,5,The novel of the 20th century.,One person found this helpful,"I personally hold this book in so high a regard that I find myself unable to make it justice by way of an extensive review, so I'll try to keep it brief. For me this is perhaps the greatest novel of the past century, almost any other book looks childish and frivolous by comparison as regards style, narrative pace, plot, structure and of course allegorical and metaphoric power (""The Trial"" by Kafka, is the only other worthy contender of ""1984"" that I can think of).Orwell masterfully describes a nightmarish future in which all individual liberties have been rooted out. The book chronicles the alienated existence of Winston Smith, a minor bureaucrat, and his personal and solitary rebellion against the establishment until the final annihilation of his personality. There is terror and horror in literature (as understood by authors like Poe, Lovecraft, Barker, etc) and then there is this book, which is one of the most disturbing experiences a reader can face in a lifetime. Some people hate it precisely because of its very bleak denouement. I can tell you that this is a compelling novel that will stay with you after days of having finished it. It is also one of the very few literary triumphs hailed in equal measure during decades by critics and readers alike. No other writer that I know of has been able to describe the sheer abstract terror exemplified by the infamous Room 101. Horror has many faces and the powers that be many ways of imposing their tyranny upon an isolated individual. Unfortunately, there are things worse and more humiliating than death, and that is what the protagonist of this terrifying novel will discover...It is difficult for me to find any kind of flaws in this book, the underlying message is tremendously powerful and the writing addictive and stylish, plus the plot leaves you virtually breathless. It ranks easily as the very best dystopian fiction ever written, and it doesn't look like it is going to be overthrown in the near future. George Orwell who, some years prior to the publication of this book, already showed to the world what he was capable of with his amazing ""Animal Farm"", inscribes himself with ease among the greatest authors of all time thanks to this masterpiece.Do not go to your grave without having read this book first.",True,humor_entertainment,1

I didn’t feel like I was missing anything, either.The proposal is your typical young adult, contemporary fiction, romance type story. The story follows Nikole after her pretentious actor ex-boyfriend proposes to her in the worst way. By the worst way, I mean on a Jumbotron at a baseball game, with her name spelled wrong. Then, he leaves her high and dry while the news cameras swarm her. Thank goodness for the admirable rescuer, Carlos!As anticipated, Nikole and Carlos start dating and doing that thing where they’re like, “no, of course we won’t fall in love. We just sleep together all the time and tell each other our deepest, darkest secrets.” Was it predictable? Yes. Was it cheesy? Yes. Did I love it? Yes.What I liked:Nikole is a strong female lead. She doesn’t make a habit of needing a man for anything, but she doesn’t take advantage of the hopeless romantic in Carlos either.The side characters are actually written really well. They each have characteristics and lives outside of their interaction with the main characters, and that makes them that much more lovable.There is actual diversity in this story without making it about diversity. The main character is a sassy, strong African American woman who falls hopelessly in love with a Latino man. Her friends are a successful, African American cupcake baking genius and a savvy, curvy Asian lesbian who brings a ton of comic relief.What I didn’t like: honestly, I liked most everything.

I’ve seen it a lot on bookstagram and it has so many good reviews. I could not help buying it.-Pros: A clear picture of the process of writting a book by a full-time writter, some quotes are phenomenal, the friendship between January and Shadi and how a true friend will go to rescue, inspiring to see how a person can accomplish a task/project that seems impossible or hard to finish, cope with problems, hope perspective on love matters, strong family boundaries.-Cons: The romance was too much of a cliché for me, i can’t simply enjoy neither believe player male characters who are relationship-phobes to keep falling for the main female character and completely change for them and fall in love almost begging them, idk, it feels like the same old story changing characters everytime, that inevitably and predictably keeps happening in most love stories. I could not connect with none of the personalities, i could not tolerate January that much, she had no special traits as to amaze me for her story and was way too selfish, like, the story could no conclude until she received “explanations” of her father reassuring her he loved her in letters. I mean, he was a great father, he was there for her, there was no doubt he loved her, yet she stops talking to her mother, the victim, punishing her more just because she (January, the queen), was not aware of the situation happening between her parents. Totally unfair and selfish attitude, did not like at all, No human being is that perfect to give everything to their partner, sometimes that’s why people are unfaithful, and that has nothing to do with the kids; i felt like the same line complaining of her father was rewinding all the story long. It was too predictable, no mistery to me, no surprise. I did no like the connection between January and Gus neither. Did not feel goose bumps when they had their moments.It was obvious they were falling in love since the first chapters. Two adults alone in a beach city, both single, spending weekends together, and flirting all the time, just because they said they weren’t falling in love wasn’t going to distract from the obvious, so it was very much predictable.I don’t pretend to be hurtful, this is just my personal opinion. I don’t think i’ll read any other books by the author, idk if I’m in a moment of my life where I’m not much into romance, but i did not enjoy that much.",True,romance,0

However, as the story progressed, I've found that it became a powerful and impactful plot line with rich characters and a number of unexpected twists. It was quite a pleasure to read and potentially one of the better books I've read recently.Some reviews have made claims to the effect that an astute reader may figure out the ending. I consider myself reasonably astute, but I was so far off on my theory that I was thrilled at the actual ending. I'm impressed if you can figure this one out; you're a much better detective than I am.The character development is surprisingly rich. It starts off fairly flat, but gains depth and complexity as the story evolves. The author switches perspectives each chapter, and terminates each one with a mini-cliffhanger, leaving the reader somewhat frustrated at the dangling threads. However, by the end of the book, the threads are all tied up.So, I highly recommend the book, and suggest that you stick with it through the beginning where the tone comes across as dreary and whiny.

182,451524934,5,A must read in a good format.,2 people found this helpful,"1984 is a classic. While the book is clearly an exaggeration (I HOPE no society could turn out quite like this), it is a needed warning for any age. It is not a book to read and try to determine ways to malign the political party with which you happen to differ, but a book that, if read properly, should leave us evaluating our society in all its aspects for tendencies toward the destructive patterns seen in the book. The story is also quite simply engrossing, and only becomes more so as the book progresses. You won't want to put it down.This particular edition contains a critical essay on the book and its significance that I found interesting and insightful.The only potential negative is that the book is designed for cost-efficiency.

And in true COHO fashion, just crushed my heart. This was such an easy read. Atlas, Lily, and Ryle were characters you loved. It was so beautiful to watch two love stories grow. While they took different turns it was truly heart wrenching to follow both. You can’t help but root for Lily. You want her to win. She is strong, tenacious, and real. What she experienced and has to go through, is hard, but it gives you a more raw picture of why she’s vulnerable. And why she makes the decisions she does. I’m stoked there’s a sequel. I couldn’t get enough of these characters! One of my favorite Colleen books! It was so hard to put down. If you haven’t read this, you must.

16807,1501128019,4,Love and Other Words,One person found this helpful,"** spoiler alert ** This is my first Christina Lauren book and I really liked it. Love and Other Words is told in alternating timelines of then and now. There is a second chance romance and friends to lovers trope between Macy and Elliot. They grew up together during years of summer vacations and holidays building their friendship to something more. After eleven years apart due to a horrible mistake Macy sees Elliott and Elliott wants to rekindle their friendship and love they have had for the other. Love and Other Words is a ""will they/won't they"" kind of story.The big negative I have is with Elliott. I absolutely don't like how he cheats on Macy at a drinking party and then years later says that he ""thought"" he was with her instead of the woman laying naked on him when Macy finds them together that fateful New Years. He then goes to play the victim card and blames Macy for running away from the issue and not allowing him to explain himself. He tries to pin the cheat on Macy making her believe everything that happened that night was on her.Nah bruh. Not happening.I did enjoy reading the book but once I got to that part I couldn't believe the audacity of Elliott and Macy's reaction.The plot is fast paced in telling their story together and I finished the book in a day.I do honestly believe that reading Every Summer After might have ruined my expectations for this book. They both have a very similar set up but Every Summer After did a much better job at pulling my heartstrings.For my first Christina Lauren book I think it was pretty good and I plan on checking out more of their reads.3.5 or 4 stars",True,romance,1

1800,786965606,4,It's d&d better than 4th,One person found this helpful,"I bought this as a gift for family bonding and bringing a new generation into the game. I started playing 2nd edition in the early 90s and dropped out when 4th came around.I'm a firm believer that what edition you start in will be your favorite but one can enjoy many editions. With that said this is a video game turned into paper and pencil. Forget what you know and get ready for new rules. Example save vs death means save or death. However in this edition it puts you in a mini game where you need to roll every turn and roll high best 3 of 5. If you win 3 points your characters are back at it but if they loose 3 then it's death. Spells are changed but the names are the same like true strike use to give +20 on your next attack but now you roll 2d20 and take the best one. Character development is also washed up with no negative traits. Like that elf has +DeX and -CHA nope all races have different bonuses but no penalties. Also it feels linear in progress as at certain levels you choose a path based class like a video game skill tree vs learning class and cross class skills. As an older player I'd rather play 3rd with the family until they're old enough for the meat grinder of 2nd or my favorite rpg set in another system. However here's why I give it a solid 4 star. The books are readily available and cheap. There's new content, minis, and it's family entertainment. If you're in your 20s or 30s buddies game group it could be fun but there's more depth in older editions.",True,humor_entertainment,1

The backgrounds and inspiration ideas add a lot to the character development process.One of the best features from the new edition is the idea of Advantage and Disadvantage on rolls. This has added alot to gameplay where many of adventuring party had thought things were lost only to get a secondary roll and turn things around. This has been especially fun for our halfling who is notorious for rolling 1's in dire situations.This book is definitely worth picking up and giving D&D a try if your new to the world of D&D and a great welcome back to those of us who have been with the series on and off from the beginning.,True,humor_entertainment,1

1159,B01IW9TM5O,5,What an amazing journey from apartheid to the Daily Show!,2 people found this helpful,"Trevor Noah tells a tale of many twists and turns from being born a crime to becoming an international, comedicpolitical figure.I had stopped watching the Daily Show after Colbert moved to The Late Show. I didn't stop watching because of Trevor, but because I didn't have time for another show and I was an avid Colbert fan. Anyway, I'd catch an episode now and then and always enjoyed his quick wit and political slant on comedy.After Trump won the nomination, I found myself staying up late watching every liberal comedy show, just to find a shred of humor in an otherwise horrific period of time. I began to ""need"" to watch the Daily Show again. Trevor had an empathy for underdogs that I very much appreciated.I had heard his book advertised several times and had intended to read it for months. After Trump's inauguration I was more politically forlorn than ever. I attended a local Women's March and met a couple who highly recommended his book. I bought it that night and began reading it immediately.The book was gripping! It it brilliantly written and brings to light many social injustices that white people in the U.S. never have to face. I learned a great deal about apartheid and the history of South Africa. It also made me think about angles of history that I'd never considered. In my world, Hitler would never be socially accepted name to give a child. Even though where I grew up, I didn't know any Jews, I still knew about the heinous acts of Hitler and couldn't imagine meeting a ""Hitler"".  In Trevor's world, the horrific connotation didn't exist, but rather it was a name of strength. He hadn't learned of German concentration camps and had witnesses his own countries' racial segregation and extermination campaign. Having a friend named Hitler was no big deal. That is just one of many thought-provoking stories within Trevor's life story.The book is full of endearing stories of finding humor in otherwise helpless, hopeless situations. It's a great read! I hope there is a sequel that covers his mother's recovery to his arrival on the Daily Show.",True,humor_entertainment,1

15833,1984806734,4,3.5 Stars,,"""I had set myself up for heartbreak and now I suspected there was nothing I could do but brace myself and wait for it to hit.""If I had picked this up first, I might have been hesitant to read People We Meet on Vacation. The vibe of these two books could not be more different. They have the same delicious, slow burn of attraction and romance with cutesy heroines and broody heroes, but that’s the extent of the overlap. Beach Read is darker, moodier, complex. Unless you’re into true crime, dark family dramas, with a smallish side of kissing, this book is anything but the beach read the title and cover suggest. There is a heaviness – much like the humidity of a Midwestern summer – that just seeps into everything. It’s not often that I would choose to pick up a book about dead mothers (his) and cheating fathers (hers), but this scratched and unknown itch amid my parade of fluffy cotton candy books. Despite its flaws, I didn’t want to stop reading.""The rain fell all around us, and I let go of everything that wasn’t Gus, wasn’t this moment. I lost myself in him, and instead of trying to convince myself that someday everything would be okay, I focused on the fact that, right now, it already was.""Emily Henry’s writing is gorgeous. I could read her prose nonstop and never tire of it. She writes some of the hottest make-out scenes I’ve read in ages that left me feeling like a raging hormone-monster teen all over again (but in a good way, if that exists?). I could have done with way less of the New Eden cult secondary plot line; it was full of abuse and trauma that I frankly didn’t feel was necessary, and ultimately is responsible for the missing stars in my rating. There was already sufficient evidence to support the “we’ve both seen some stuff, but let’s bang it all better” that was always going to happen between Gus and January. Unless their joint investigation somehow wrapped back around to directly impacting our MCs, the only cult I’m interested in when it comes to romance is that of Meg Ryan.""I know no matter how long I get to love you, it will be worth whatever comes next.""",False,romance,1

I also liked the different perspectives. Not just a one sided story like most books. Everyone ties in together one way or another. I gave a 4 star rating due to some bits being too lengthy or too cliche and no real reason as to why the suspect did what they did. Cliffhanger. Other than that...a good read.",True,mystery,1

2394,1451673310,5,"“There must be something in books, something we can’t imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house""",208 people found this helpful,"'It was a pleasure to burn.'It's such a famous opening line and despite the fact that I'd never read Fahrenheit 451, one I've seemed to know for the longest time. It would crop up every so often in my life, usually at trivia nights. I knew it was a classic book, the type reluctant schoolchildren are assigned to read as part of their curriculum. As a progressive I always felt I was doing it a disservice by not reading it, so I set out to buy it on Amazon and finished it in under a day.Let's tackle the plot first.It's set in a Mid-West American city in a dystopian future. Our hero, Guy Montag, is a fireman except firemen in the future don't put out fires, they cause them. Books are forbidden and if any are discovered they are burned, including the house hiding them. Montag has no qualms with this, until one day he's called out to the house of an elderly lady. She chooses to set fire to herself and her house before Montag can do it. Shaken to the core by this, he tries to share it with his wife Mildred, but she's too addicted to vapid and superficial television shows to engage in conversation. Her big concern is getting a fourth TV. The only person he develops a connection to is his teenage neighbour, Clarisse. She's free-spirited and questions him constantly. One day she goes missing. Mildred casually tells him that Clarisse is dead.Montag starts to wonder if books are really so bad. He steals a book of poetry from a house he's called out to burn. His chief begins to grow suspicious of him and pontificates about the dangers of books and independent thinking. Montag begins to feel rebellious as he rails against the hedonistic nature of society. One night Mildred invites some girlfriends over. Montag rashly brings his book out and recites poetry to them, moving one woman to tears. The others are mortified and Montag finds himself in serious trouble. I'll stop here before spoilers creep in.I was interested to learn Bradbury's inspiration for this book. Apparently he was once out walking at night with a fellow writer when a police car pulled up and an officer got out. He asked Bradbury what he was doing, to which he responded that he was walking, ""Putting one foot in front of the other."" The officer was unamused with what he considered a smark aleck response and told him never to do it again. Bradbury was so angry that he went home and wrote a short story about a man who lived in a time when walking was considered a crime. Bradbury was also outraged at the persecution of artists by Senator Joseph McCarthy, and the House of un-American Activities.Many writers far better equipped than myself have wrestled writing a treatise for this book, so I'll leave further analysis to them. I just wanted to say that despite the obvious allegory in the story, I think it works just as a simple tale about the importance of books. Books have always been a big presence in my life. From as far back as I can remember, I have always had a full bookcase, jam-packed with titles in my bedroom. I was a voracious reader, blithely leaving books wherever I finished them (invariably not in said bookcase). I grew complacent and took it for granted that I was free to read whatever I chose. It was only as I grew older that I began learning about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, about the Nazi book burnings, and about the scorching and burial of texts and hundreds of Confucian scholars in ancient China. It's sobering stuff and made me think. I know of no country that doesn't have an undercurrent of anti-intellectualism. Generally books are considered deep (though plenty aren't), and there will always be those whom openly distrust (to the point of hostility) those deemed 'highfalutin and clever.' It is entirely plausible that at some stage in the future, books will be banned in any given country. If nothing else Fahrenheit 451 should serve as a warning against authoritarianism, and for a call to keep the free flow of knowledge and art alive. When I cast a roving eye on the pile of books next to me, I am full of appreciation and awe. I will protect them from any fire.",True,humor_entertainment,1

2007,1451673310,5,Classic Dystopian Novel; Heed its Warning,One person found this helpful,"Guy Montag, the main character, is a fire fighter, but in this society, fire fighters aren't called to put out fires, they start them.  Montag is married to Mildred, a woman who is completely consumed by the shows that are displayed daily on the video walls.  Early in the book, Montag meets a girl, who is his neighbor.  Their various encounters cause Montag to re-evaluate his perception of his job, society, and how he plans to live.There are a number of disturbing things in this book that are relevant to today's society.- Mildred is mindlessly consumed by the video walls and has a desire for more walls.  Today in America, the entertainment industry is HUGE.  Movie stars, tv hosts, professional athletes, and musicians are paid millions of dollars while school teachers are paid next to nothing.  We are Mildred.  We are consumed by entertainment.  Movies, Music, TV shows, Video games, Books, Radio, etc, etc, etc.  The good news is that we can still choose to escape all of this, at least partially.- The robotic dog at the firehouse is able to monitor the people to see if they what the firehouse wants - books.  Today, I would relate the dog to the ability to be tracked online.  Almost everyones personal information is online on sites such for  Banking, Social Media, Public Tax Records, or Online Stores.  The NSA, Google, and Facebook all compile information and track users.  They are all looking for particular information on you to either make money by selling your information or to prevent terrorist activity.  We are being watched, just like Montag.- People are not as intelligent in the book due to the hatred for books & love of their video walls and what takes place on them.",True,humor_entertainment,1

I bought it before my vacation wanting something easy and light. I tip my hat to the marketing department because between the title,  cover illustration, and synopsis they really did sell it as a light summer vacation read. The book starts with January mourning her father's death, learning he has a mistress, and inheriting a summer beach house. She moves in to make the house sellable, because she's broke, and because her boyfriend broke up with her because she's was no longer fun to be around while coping with all of that. Clearly she needs the project of fixing up her grouchy next door neighbor too. Turns out he has also just been dumped for his best friend. But the reason this is so horrible is because it was done on his birthday, he was previously abandoned by his mother, and was physically abused by his father. But 'it wasn't that bad'. January spent several chapters trying to get the back story of trauma out of her neighbor/friend/lover and then that story line just dropped. They spend the rest of the book alternating nights between each other's houses and writing what must have been the worst novels ever written.  We're supposed to magically believe they fall head over heels in love even though there's little focus on the romance except the middle of the book when January is trying teach her grouchy neighbor how to write a romantic comedy and meet cute. Which apparently means writing a novel about a cult. Seriously. Just skip it. Or wait your turn in the library queue to read it for free.",True,romance,-1

15752,1984806734,5,Couldn't put it down!,,"I haven’t had a good book hangover in too long. Emily Henry’s writing sucked me in and refused to let go. At first blush, the storyline couldn’t seem more cliche—quintessential rom-com and practically begging for a Hallmark movie of it’s very own. However, that is where the predictability ends. I was swept off my feet in a way I wasn’t expecting at all when I picked up this novel.January and Gus were rivals in college and had built successful careers in opposing genres of writing. 6 years later, they come face-to-face again in a small lake town in Michigan. Their fiery feud picked up right where it left off. The banter and smoldering friction between January and Gus legitimately had me laughing out loud and telling my cat, “Ugh, they are so stinkin cute!” After agreeing to a little wager between frienemies, we get to follow them through a series of both heartbreaking and heartwarming “dates” in the name of research. The friendship-first way they fall in love is so much fun. Henry really captured the way I think we all hope we get to fall in love, with someone we can laugh, cry, and fight with—with someone who not only sees all our broken pieces, but who helps us pick them up off the floor and holds them gently in their hands until we’re ready to deal with reconstruction.Beach Read is not just a romance. Yes, it’s a love story, but it’s also a life story. We get to experience the loving, dramatic, grief-stricken, and supportive relationships January has with her best friend, her mother, and even her deceased father. Henry beautifully expresses how sticky and excruciating life can become, especially when you least expect it. But, there is always something to be grateful for, something to learn about yourself, even when the only victory you can claim is simple perseverance, survival. Getting to the other side of our pain, and taking time to live, time to love, in the present moments we are given, will always be worth it.You will root for Gus and January the entire time. Henry was masterful in orchestrating a close that kept me blissfully nervous and hopeful for our protags right up until the last couple of chapters. Despite starting the book confident I could predict the way it would all play out, I never found myself fully sure until the 2nd to last chapter, and at that point, it was exactly the ending I wanted.I wish this book didn’t have to end. I wasn’t ready to put it down. But it now has a prestigious place on my “read again... and again” shelf.",False,romance,1

Also — why did we have to wait until the very end of the book to for them to realize what they realized about each other? I would have loved for it to have been in the middle and for us to see how they grew with each other. It became long and drawn out around 65% of the story I wanted it to be finished.

This is the first novel I have read from this author and though I wasn’t disappointed, I wasn’t in love with it either.Augustus and January are rivals from college who now find themselves living next door to one another in a small town. A town where everyone knows everything. Though it’s not January’s first choice, she decides to make the most of being there and work on her next novel, but she’s struggling. Augustus happens to have writers block as well, so they strike up a deal. They will switch genres and help each other gain a new perspective. What they discover is that they both are not strangers to adversity.Parts of the story were really charming and the banter was incredibly clever. I also loved how the characters back stories were woven into the book. This is what propelled me to finish the story. I just kept chasing after breadcrumbs, trying to figure out why Augustus behaved the way he did. But, ultimately, I just wanted more of everything. I wanted the author to take what she had already written and jack it up on steroids.Overall, it was a charming read that had much more emotion and depth than what I anticipated, but I needed more from the story.  I needed more tension and angst.Explicit rating: This is not necessarily a closed door read, but it’s as close as you can get. The intimate scenes are not very descriptive and so it’s a safe novel for the more conservative audiences.",True,romance,0

El libro es fluido, adictivo y rápido de leer, con capítulos cortos y una narrativa fresca.El romance es un punto central en la trama, pero hay muchos temas alrededor, el duelo, la perdida, sus heridas del pasado y obviamente la escritura toma un papel fundamental, me gusto ver esa parte de investigación que ellos como escritores hacen, el proceso que siguen para escribir un libro, y claro, como sufren y afrontan sus bloqueos creativos.Lo que me ha gustado de su romance es que puedo ver porqué los protagonistas encajan juntos, tienen mucha química y se complementan. Tanto Gus como January están estancados en sus vidas y vamos descubriendo diferentes matices de sí mismos a través de de su pasado, secretos y situaciones que ayudan a expandir y darle profundidad a su historia.Mi única queja seria es que todo el libro esta contado bajo la perspectiva de January. Sí, vamos conociendo a Gus al mismo tiempo que lo hace ella pero dejamos de lado su manera de ver el mundo que como hacen tanta referencia en este libro, sus perspectivas de la vida y personalidades son completamente diferentes y hubiera sido interesante tener ambos POV.",True,romance,1

She finds out he wasn't who she thought he was and then her long time boyfriend breaks up with her leaving her homeless and she can no longer write a happy ending since she does not believe in them anymore.Force to move into the beach house her father left her that she never knew he owned she is shocked and annoyed that her neighbor is the renowned writer Augustus Everett who she briefly knew in college. He is smug and arrogant and annoyingly a talented writer. He too is distracted and suffering from writers block. So they make a deal. He will write a romance she will write the great American novel and whoever sells their book first will help promote the other's book. She takes him on romantic dates so he understands what her readers want and he takes her to talk to survivors of a deadly cult. He does make her promise one thing: To not fall in love with him!This book had moments of hilarity, sorrow, revelation, fear, and romance. The emotions all showed up at the right time.

Born a Crime reminded me of the importance of reading and the power of books. When you read about another’s history and challenges, in a tiny way you walk in their shoes.I was aware of Apartheid in the abstract, but details are what build empathy. South Africa categorized Trevor Noah at birth as someone less than others. The book is a clear reminder why we should celebrate Apartheid’s demise. Born a Crime was a perfect title.As an American, I shared the frustration of another country's struggle with racism. Apartheid reminded me of “separate but equal,” expanded to greater cruelties.Incredibly, the book isn’t a downer. Somehow Noah tells his tales with humor and a relaxed attitude.

After hearing about his South African background, I wanted to know even more.  As I began reading, I began to realize that this was no ordinary book. This is a classic story about two very unusual people.  A woman who stood apart from every part of the world she was born into, and her son who grew up into an even more unusual man.Behind and surrounding them is a view of a nation emerging from a tyranny that disgusted the whole world.  Trevor does not sugar coat this part of history.  Injustice did not vanish in a sudden burst of enlightenment.  The nation underwent a violent change and many tragic events occurred.

I am in awe at how Trevor Noah was able to create this amazing/inspiring/funny/historical book, it is such a gift to the world. I’m very sad that it is over (1st world problems haha). Trevor starts the book as a child in South Africa and goes into detail the different struggles of growing up during the transition of Apartheid to Nelson Mandela era. The book goes on into Noah’s teenage years where he was quite the trouble maker and very interesting to read about. I laughed out loud multiple times throughout this book. I would have finished it quicker, but was restricted due to book club discussion points. READ THIS BOOK!!! Favorite quotes:“That, and so many other smaller incidents in my life, made me realize that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people.”“When I look back, I realize she raised me like a white kid—not white culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered.”“I remember the thing that caused the trauma, but I don't hold on to the trauma. I never let the memory of something painful prevent me from trying something new.”And maybe my favorite quote from the book,“I wasn't popular but I wasn't an outcast. I was everywhere with everybody, and at the same time I was all by myself.” - so relatable to me. As an ENTJ (not that that has anything to do with it really haha) I hardly relate to anyone. I am always surrounded by people, and get along well with most people, but I find myself feeling alone a lot, not lonely, I gratefully never ever feel lonely. Just feeling alone in my thoughts/morals/ethics. I don’t let this feeling affect my happiness though! I am very very content having taboo opinions and being on the side of the minority about current issues.And the quote that almost put me in tears,“We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited.” This really strung a cord with me because I was always told as a child to, “follow your dreams”, but then constantly shot down when proclaiming anything outside of the norm. Fortunately, I overcame this and thought outside the box, and did not let my upbringing affect my future life plans and now work my dream job.This book is amazing, and you’re missing out (FOMO for real weirdos that feel that) if you don’t read it!",True,humor_entertainment,1

It takes some of the best ideas from previous versions and combines them into a game that's better than the sum of its parts.  The major shift that players of 3rd and 4th editions will need to get used to is the power curve as it relates to magic items; it isn't necessary to layer on magical equipment of increasing power in order for character level to keep up with the opposition.  As a result, magic equipment is going to go back to being a special treat rather than a commodity.Pros:Cleaned up combat system allows the game to be run with or without miniaturesBalances classes without making them all mechanically identicalMagic system is back to a pre-4e framework, with some added flexibilityCons:Proficiency bonus system is vanilla (and I don't mean that it is subtle yet delicious)Debuffs are still nerfed from 4e; affected targets generally get a chance to shake it off every roundAs is the case with everything, we'll see how time and additional releases impact the quality of the game overall.",True,humor_entertainment,1

The constant will they, won't they gets old, and there are pages of graphic sex to slog through.  I'm not a prude but I really don't need all of the details, and much of it involved being in uncomfortable places (up against a shelving unit in one case), even though they were in a house with an actual bed.  I had to make myself finish this because I paid for it based on all of the great reviews--it took me a whole week and I am a fast reader, but it was so repetitive and boring I had to keep putting it down.

I can see it being helpful to people who tend to take everyone and everything at face value. The truth is, that is a very dangerous attitude to have.

669,451526341,5,Parallels to Contemporary Society are Uncanny,,"I had to read this book for my classics book club. Short and easy, font and outline flow fast. The story though.... *shudder*! At first is was blatantly obvious that Orwell was writing about Communism and the state of affairs in the Soviet Union. Another reviewer quite well detailed all the characters and who there were in real life including the Union's (the original) five year plan of economics (the windmill) of progress to transform Soviet society. And that it was written in 1945, yeah, it's about the USSR. Beyond that though, when you get into it about half way after they run off one of the main characters (snowball) and the real tyrant takes over (napoleon), you begin to see the parallels to contemporary culture and society. How the animals never seem to figure out what is going on right in front of them. Even when they do stand up, they are punished by death for their crimes and rebellion. Then the propaganda from one of the more intelligent animals leads them to forget and believe they didn't remember things correctly, all in the name of the pigs implementing and fooling the less intelligent animals into their serfdom. I see it as contemporary social and political events that are happening in the U.S. and withing the Republican party. Eventually the other animals aren't able to distinguish the pigs from humans and the cycle has started all over again. Very sad story, but how many people have lived this or are living it right now? The sense of freedom and change that is corrupted, twisted and silenced, which turns right back into the cycle. The oppressed become the oppressor.

Love and Other Words completely captivated me from start to finish.

Their story was one that had me laughing, crying, swooning, and sighing. Their story was one of friendship versus emptiness, love against like, thriving compared to existing. It was a journey to understand how two people could be scarred so differently by loss and untruths, and whether or not those things could be overcome to resurrect their long-ago friendship and love.Switching between past and present flawlessly, in Macy’s eyes, we lived through the awkwardness of teenage years, and stumbled through the stressors of adult life. I couldn't put this book down, needing to know how Macy had become so emotionally destitute and isolated. I hurt for her, and dearly wanted her to find joy in life. I was transfixed, desperate to see if time, confessions, and healing would light or destroy young love’s fire.

687,451526341,5,"Shhh, No high school students allowed, Animal Farm, it's a secret...",5 people found this helpful,"Animal Farm by George Orwell  I first read this book 10 years after I was out of high school. I remember my high school english instructor saying something along these lines, ""I see no reason to have you read Animal Farm."" Of course this was the same instructor pushing Clinton/Gore bumper stickers on us for extra credit (kind of like telling kindergardners you'll give them as many Jolly Ranchers as they want if they vote clinton/gore). I was young, impressionable, and living with two far left parents (they both voted for Mondale for God sake). Years later I was actually listening to Michael Savage while in grid lock traffic. He was talking about our current political climate and discussing it in relation to Animal Farm (I had no frame of referance). I was still a far left little wacko myself and was only listening to Savage so I could argue with him (Portland Oregon has a way of doing that to impressionable youth). This was the moment I started to awake from my fog. I decided to purchase this fine book (got it used right here on Amazon for less than a dollar).  If you want specifics about the story this is the wrong review for you. Instead I am going to focus on what this story did to open my eyes. I began to read this book and amazingly my entire political universe changed. Why did my high school teacher decide this book wasn't important. If anything the story is historical in that it describes the reality of the American mind during the cold war. How was this book tossed aside so easily by teachers who were supposed to be teaching me to think for myself? The clouds started to lift from my eyes. I began to realize that I had been blindly following like the rest of the sheeple. That's when I started reading, thinking, not believing statements just because so and so said so.  I eventually gave this book away at a garage sale. It was hard for me to part with this tathered old library copy of Animal Farm. The old horse (Boxer was his name right?) who kept trying to work harder for the Marxist Pigs; only to be sold for slaughter once his usefulness to the Pigs had come to an end. It reminds me of the middle class who say to themselves ""I must work harder"" in our current society to maintain their current standard of living. Will we as Americans end up at the financial slaughter house because of the free trade practices of semi socialist government? Most don't realize that Marx expressed the need for free trade in letters to Engels in order to bring down the bourgeois.  The pigs preached in the beginning that ""four legs good, two legs bad."" Sounds like the nonsense that disseminates like a disease from the Repugnicans and Demoncrats. They both spew their hate and promise change. Yet somehow just like the pigs they both end up walking on two legs in the end. The end of the book states that men were with the pigs (playing cards I believe). They started to fight and their countanences were the same.  This book is a must read if your teacher just so happened to leave this off your high school reading list. Originally written to depict communism. How sad that you can see communism spreading into our own society now.",True,humor_entertainment,1

17146,1501128019,5,"Love, then and now",One person found this helpful,"A first foray into the genre of Women’s Fiction from the writing team of Christina Lauren, Macy and Elliott’s story is told concurrently by switching back and forth between two timelines: then and now. The initial flashback reads like a coming of age story where we see Macy and Elliot first meeting as teens who then develop a long lasting, deep relationship. They are both ardent readers so books and words are intrinsic to their time together and personal growth. The other part of the story is an adult contemporary romance. Two catastrophic events in Macy’s life define her: the first, the early loss of her mother which is the reason her father purchased a weekend/summer home in Elliot’s small town outside of San Francisco. The second event is a one-two punch also intertwined with Elliot fomenting their breakup after a heartbreaking betrayal. Neither Macy nor Elliot have even gotten over the other and when a chance meeting brings them back together again, they have a second opportunity at love. Since their breakup, Macy has lived a numbed emotional life too afraid to ever invest her heart in anyone again. Although she is engaged, Sean is a safe choice and no risk to her soul. Elliott did not fare much better over the years not really understanding how Macy could just disappear from his life all the while knowing he hurt her deeply. Their connection went beyond a teen crush as both had expected to be together forever. Clearly Macy and Elliott were soulmates even at a young age so the loss of their relationship for eleven years has been emotionally wrenching to both of them. Fortunately Macy has a friend, Sabrina, who really sees past her defenses pushing Macy to go out of the safe zone to be honest about who and what she wants.This story is told very well keeping me invested in the characters and riding the emotional roller coaster right along with them. Macy and Elliot seem so right together that you want them to find their way home because that is what they are for each other: home. The backdrop of their reading together and falling in love as they grow up is very appealing as well for readers who highly value the written and spoken word. Their long separation is also frustrating to those of us with tender hearts who don’t like the idea of people who clearly belong together losing their way. It seemed a little odd to me that neither Macy nor Elliot tracked down the other after such a close relationship; however, other than that aspect, I enjoyed this story.

The story keeps you engaged as well as having a good plot.

At points, I swear I could feel what the main character Winston was going through. Even though I will not spoil the story, I will tell you that this is not a ""happy story"" with a kind of ""hero saves the day"" ending. This book brings up what was believed to be a genuine concern from the past in a very descriptive, yet depressing way. I don't know how Orwell pulled this off, but this turned out to be a very good book that kept me engaged the entire time.Also, if you do happen to run across the movie, I would definitely recommend watching it.

2285,1451673310,3,The Story Does Not Tell Itself,4 people found this helpful,"Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 is disappointing on a number of levels.  Bradbury’s characters gets bogged down in extended social and political speeches about the main topic of the novel, the place of books, and the ideal of learning and self-betterment.  Of course, this is a deep topic, demanding great attention.  But Bradbury falls into the didactic trap.He does not allow the story to tell itself, but forces it upon his readers.  The result is a stilted tale, betraying a strong element of propaganda, to the detriment of the narrative flow.Bradbury avoided this trap in The Martian Chronicles.  There, the characters play out their lives in the shadow of great events, and we see these reflected in their struggles.  Fahrenheit 451 gets it the opposite way around ­– and the novel flounders.",True,humor_entertainment,0

5879,578629097,1,Ableist illustrations. Normalizes aggravated assault against disabled children,,"I'm a teacher, google certified educator, and disability rights advocate.This book keeps coming up in politics and education blogs, so I read it. I find nothing politically objectionable. It's a warmed over rehash of the whole ""It Takes a Village"" bit released by Senator Clinton, but targeted at kids. I'd just give it 3 stars if not for a particularly offensive issue which I was shocked to find in a book published in the 2020s.The book repeatedly shows youths touching the disabled youth's wheelchair (indicated in the pictures I took and on the cover). A wheelchair under the law is an extension of the body and as such, this is assault, not help. This book is training pre-K students how to assault children with disabilities and normalizing the practice. It is not OK to touch mobility aids without permission, It is not ""helping"".  It is assault. In some states, it's aggravated assault due to disability status. This is something I'd expect in a book 20 or 30 years ago, not one released just now.Some people may think this is a nitpick or overly dramatic, but it's not, it just shows how marginalized our community is when its complaints are so often dismissed that things like assault don't even register as an issue. If someone walked up to you while you were standing still at a bus stop and picked you up or shoved you because you were different or just in the way, or just sat on your legs and started smoking or just generally treated you like furniture, would you think that was odd? Yet many people using mobility aids experience this kind of violation constantly. The mobility aid is an extension of the body and treated as such under the law. Person with mobility disabilities are moved out of the way when it's convenient, like trash. Amidst the Covid-19 geocide, many of our lives were forfeit because a plurality of America couldn't be bothered by a touch of chafing.Autonomy of disabled youths should also be encouraged. While much of this is beyond scope of a children's book focused on something else, the simple solution is not to show other kids touching the youth with a disability's wheelchair. If they fixed the illustrations so it didn't promote the normalization of violence against disabled people among children, I'd give it 3 stars.",False,children,-1

It attempts to fix a lot of what was ""broken"" in the 4th edition, and in most cases succeeds. There's no point in going into details of the changes made to the game over the years and how they affect gameplay, as they are countless hobby sites that already do that. Here I'll just say that as someone who's been playing D&D (and other RPG's) for nearly 30 years, and was (like many others) disappointed by the 4th edition, I can recommend the new edition - both old time fans of the game, and newcomers wanting to give it a go, should definitely pick up this edition - it's very easy to start, making it good for both old timers who don't have much time to spend on the hobby anymore but still want to play, and players new to RPG's or to this system. However, in spite of being perhaps the simplest version of D&D so far, there's still room for depth and character customisation.

I started reading it the day before on the 20th and finished it the next day since this was a book that was hard to put down. It put me through an emotional wreck, especially at the end of the book. I was literally in tears that my hubs asked me what was wrong? I couldn’t tell him because he would have never understood.Christina Lauren left me hanging until the very end on what happened between the main character and her first and only love of her life. Why were they not together in their adult lives? I wanted to know, which is why it didn’t take me long to read this book.One thing to mention is that the book is told by one character and that is Macy Sorensen. You don’t get another POV in this story, which makes it a WF/Chick Lit story. First, you are introduced to her as an adult and then she happens to run into someone from her past, Elliot Petropoulos who she thought would be her forever. In comes the back and forth chapters of Macy and Elliot as teenagers and present-day adults to finally get to the bottom on what happened between the two.First off, I love Elliot Petropoulos in this book. This young man here is what I would consider the perfect best guy friend who would be the ideal boyfriend. So many personality traits and qualities about him that won me over, especially after realizing he loves to read books. Macy also loves to read books. (Seriously, a couple that loves to read together. LOVE!)This book has a lot of friendship, tension, angst, sadness, and romance in it. The very end will be the big doozy of them all though. Be prepared to have tissues on hand.This book gets 5 stars from me, and I highly recommend it to readers that love Women’s Fiction (Chick Lit) and even fans of Contemporary Romance.

It was not only funny and endearing, but so interesting and educational to learn about class, culture, and race in South Africa in and around the years Mandela was freed.

I worried that it would be 200 plus pages of forced comedy in an effort to make sure it was funny, but he didn't and didn't need to. Humor was subtle and used where needed to get to know him better understand his life and surroundings, it was perfect.

Growing up, I was heavily abused, but everyone turned the blind eye despite me showing very obvious signs of being abused. Reading Jennette's book made me feel like I was reading about my own mom on those pages. Personally, I was pretty unphased by most of the content because I can relate to it so much and it was basically ""normal"" for me to deal with that stuff from my mom growing up.

17844,399587683,3,Light easy read but nothing too strenuous,,"Personally, I find the idea of a public proposal mortifying, whether it's in front of friends and family, a restaurant, or in Nik Paterson's case, at a Dodgers game with 45,000 people. Little did she know that's what would happen when she attended a game with Fisher, her boyfriend of five months, his man bun, and some bros. She thought their ""relationship"" was about having a good time and he, well, he didn't have much brains. After she said no, he and his friends flee the scene, leaving her to face the camera crew in the stadium by herself when lo and behold, Carlos and Angela, two complete strangers, come to her rescue and get her out of there. Afterward, Nikole and Carlos embark on a fling. Will it lead to more? Yes, obviously. Will it lead to happily ever after? Yes, also obviously.I will start by saying that I liked this book a lot more than ""The Wedding Date,"" the author's debut novel. I breezed through this light, easy read in a few days, and overall, found myself enjoying the book and the dynamic between the two leads. Nik and Carlos both conformed to type: Nik, as the independent, successful woman who doesn't want or need a man to fulfill her life, and Carlos, a man who thinks all the woman in his life need taking care of after the patriarch of the family died five years before. A lot of readers have suggested this book and the one prior to it focus a lot on diversity but I didn't get that vibe. With the exception of one or two items said, I didn't feel like race was brought up. The one significant standout was when Nik and Alexa meet and they both exclaim to eachother, ""I didn't know you were black."" I thought there was potential there to dig in.The writing was good but there was too much exposition and too many cliches for me. There were moments when it seemed over the top, like at the end.

I can't say much more without spoiling it but it was a disappointment. I did like Gus but probably because he reminds me of my favorite ex, in all the ways I fell in love with him.

This is the summer romance I’ve been waiting for! January is at a low point in her life. She is grieving the death of her father, but now she’s not so sure that she really knew him. She is also suffering from writers block and trying to pick up the pieces after her longtime boyfriend broke up with her. Her father left her a beach house on Lake Michigan and she’s hoping the change of scenery will help her clear her head and figure some things out. In a crazy turn of fate her next-door neighbor at the beach house is her old college crush/rival Gus. When the two start to talk they realize that they both are struggling from writers Blok so decide to wager a little bet and each will try to write in the others genre. So what happens when the grumpy literary author tries to write a romcom? What happens when the romcom author attempts to write a bleak book? What happens when too lonely hearts find each other?

This books just goes to show that money can't fix the things inside of you that are already broken until you do a little work yourself. There's some tearful moments and some light hearted moments. Growing up as an iCarly fan it read like a behind the scenes bit at times. I remember some of the episodes mentioned. While she was busy making us laugh on screen off screen she was not doing well. I'm happy she's better now and I understand why she named the title what the title is. Her journey to stability and health took some time for her to understand that her mother was not the hero she thought she was. That's a hard pill to swallow.,True,humor_entertainment,1

Carlos is an amazing man and I want to be besties with Nik and her girls!  Nik is at a Dodger’s game with her casual boyfriend, Fisher. The very last thing she is expecting at this game is a proposal. I mean, who proposes to someone they’ve been dating for 5 months? And someone they’re not even serious about? Nik is befuddled and of course says no. Fisher storms out and it puts Nik in a position. Thankfully, Carlos and his sister, Angela help Nik out and get her out of there.Carlos likes Nik right away. There is something about her that draws him to her. Neither one of them are looking for a relationship, but they form this friendship, and that friendship turns into sex. As long as it’s just friends with benefits things will be fine. Nik can’t do a relationship now, and Carlos has too many family things on his plate. But when someone catches the feelings- things get a little tricky.If you’ve read The Wedding Date, you know Carlos is best friends with Drew. It was nice to get their little cameo in this book.

1019,B01IW9TM5O,5,A quick and very worthwhile read,12 people found this helpful,"Trevor Noah is best known (at least in the US) as the host of the _Daily Show_, who replaced Jon Stewart when he left the program. This is his memoir.Noah was born in South Africa under apartheid, to a Xhosa mother and a Swiss father. Their having had intercourse was a crime, thus the title. His mother (and, to a lesser extent, his father) had to take extreme measures to prevent anyone from realizing his background; indeed, she lied about his paternity on his birth certificate. As a result, he grew up culturally ""black,"" but was, to the eye, ""colored"" (meaning mixed-race in South African terminology: there were blacks, coloreds, Indians, and whites in rising order, but mainly the whites played the other groups against each other. Interestingly, Chinese were considered ""black,"" but Japanese ""white"").By the time he was ten, he had burned down a white family's house (by accident) and thrown from a moving vehicle by his mother (on purpose, but for an excellent reason). Both are fascinating stories which I won't spoil.A lot of the book is about growing up under apartheid and in the chaos that followed its fall. A lot more is about his mother's determination to raise her sons to be whole people, not second-class citizens with no history and no future. She is an amazing woman, who simply does not accept limitations.The book is by turns (sometimes very close together) moving, funny, and horrifying - the horrifying part being mostly what it was like to be black (or, even worse, ""colored"") in South Africa in those days.Noah has a simple, breezy writing style that matches his material well.

It’s that sarcastic ‘I hate you but really I like you but don’t want you to know because I don’t know if you like me too’ kind of talk.Very light hearted story but a perfect “ Beach Read”We had another social distancing book club and to make it fun we went with the beach theme.

So, well.. this book had none of that.It was a perfectly sweet romance, between characters who felt real, and met (or re-met) when they were struggling through their own personal demons. And through the story we saw them grow and evolve, which was really gratifying. Moreover, I personally enjoyed the fact that the lead pair were both authors, who wrote in diverse genres, and the nerd in me truly enjoyed the commentary on them, shared in the book.But when it came to the romance.. I honestly felt it was kind of bland because it was fairly smooth sailing. Which I know is nice and everything, especially in real life, but it made me question my whole world view regarding this in books, lol.

1080,B01IW9TM5O,5,"A tribute to Noah’s Mother, and when God is your health insurance",,"Where to begin?  This book is a very powerful tribute to Noah’s Mother. As far as how he became a comedian, it is not described in this book. There is one little blurb mentioning he was starting to tour some in England, but not a word about how he got started in comedy, or anything about the process. It’s more about his life and adventures when he was young, and his relationship with his Mother. He draws readers very quickly into the book by talking about his Mother taking him to church, and yes, he does it with delightful humor.He starts with: “My childhood involved church, or some form of church, at least four nights a week.” Later, he says: “Jubilant church was mixed church. Analytical church was white church. And passionate, cathartic church, that was black church.It doesn’t take long to find out his Mother is very devout. She was a very strong lady who had her wild days when she was younger, but later she wanted something deeper and more profound in her life, so she turned to God. There’s a feistiness to her that you can’t help but respect. Noah describes Apartheid as Apart hate, and how different tribes were used to turn against each other. The fact that there are so many backgrounds and languages is very interesting. Tribes such as Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, Vende, Tsonga, etc.On you-tube, you can watch Noah’s Grandmother saying to Noah, “you was born a crime,” the title of this book. In South Africa, it was against the law for people of different races to have children together. Noah describes all the problems this caused in his life, and the difficulty and awkwardness of being colored.He has some pretty profound and interesting comments in his book, such as:“I soon learned that the quickest way to bridge the race gap was through language.”This comment in “The Cheese Boys” chapter really gave me pause for his insight:“The hood made me realize that crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn’t do: crime cares. Crime is grassroots. Crime looks for the young kids who need support and a lifting hand. Crime offers internship programs and summer jobs and opportunities for advancement. Crime gets involved in the community. Crime doesn’t discriminate.”Noah’s Mother, and the rest of the family suffered physical abuse from her husband Abel. She said to Noah: “Pray for Abel,” she’d say. “Because he doesn’t hate us. He hates himself.” Noah later mentions “Growing up in a home of abuse, you struggle with the notion that you can love a person you hate, or hate a person you love.”I will not expound on the rest of the story. There is a lot of fun and interesting stories that Trevor talks about growing up, and the outcome for his Mother and Noah, you just need to read. I did find it disturbing that not only does South Africa have a racial problem, but misogyny as well. It seems to go hand in hand. Currently America seems to be having an uptick of racism and misogyny as well. I do not know if South Africa still has as many problems, but I am guessing they still do.It’s a great book to read.

I am getting a little misty just thinking about how wonderful this story was!Who?Macy - A doctor, who is engaged to an older, financially stable man, with whom she enjoys a comfortable relationship, but has yet to fully commit to him.Elliot - Macy's former best friend and first love, who broke her heart, but still does not know why she disappeared from his life.What?After 11 years, fate intervenes, and Macy crosses paths with Elliot. From the very first glance at their reunion, Macy knew there was still a spark, and realizes how much she missed him in her life, but can she forgive him for what happened in the past and rekindled their friendship?Why?I honestly do not know where to start extolling my love for this book, but here's a list of things worth noting.• This book made me feel so many things. I smiled and laughed and swooned, but I also shed a bunch of tears. There were sad tears and tragic tears, but there were also a bunch of happy tears.• Man! Talk about making me wait! Christina Lauren kept the whole story to themselves for the bulk of the book, which made me nuts, but also kept me flipping the pages. As they flip between past and present, it's hard to understand what happened to destroy this friendship.• I loved the alternating timeline, because it let me watch two romances unfold.• I got to see them grow from ages 13 - 18, and I loved seeing what a beautiful and solid friendship they had. Some of the things they discussed were so intimate, and I have to comment Elliot on being such a great ""girlfriend"" to Macy when she really needed it.• I have a special place in my heart for second chance romances, because they give me hope that not all endings are permanent, and the authors gave us one truly beautiful one in this book.• Can we just talk about how wonderful Elliot's family was? They were so vibrant and loving and I want them to adopt me, but mostly I loved them, because of how lovely they were to Macy.• Macy's dad was pretty special too. He had to raise his daughter on his own, and thank goodness, mom left him a list, because though he was trying, it was tough for him. I loved all the effort he made and his love and adoration for Macy was so obvious.• These two were readers, like HUGE book nerds, and nobody loves a book nerd more than another book nerd. And seriously, their friendship and romance grew within the walls of Macy's closet-library.• I loved Elliot!! I loved young Elliot and I loved grown Elliot. He was perfect, but he was precious. He was always very open and honest and he spoke from the heart, and he loved full on.And, because I am such a sap, I have to dry the tears that started falling as I recounted things about this book.

Such was the case of some countries of the Soviet Union that achieved liberation, but still others continue to fall into the same abyss from which they can't rise, or don't want to, since that parasite has crawled in the mind of their crowd, as did happen in North Korea, China, etc.Animal Farm shows the perfect example of how the unhealthy idea of ​​a cheap Socialism began to take root to become a dictatorial Communism, as it happens in Venezuela today. Its strange end leaves a bitter taste that perhaps the writer did on purpose to open the consciousness of future generations. An open ending that forces the reader to ask himself: what is the solution? And how will it end?Through human experiences of the animals of this farm, we can identify this truth that still lingers in some shady societies of the present. The solution is in our hands. It will depend on the degree of preparation, culture, moral values, determination, and courage people have to free their homeland and achieve a better future. Remember governments must fear the people and not the opposite.After that, I summarize my point of view about the strongest references dealt with through the characters in this book (that can be easily identify and distinguished when you start to read the story) in the following sections:1) Leaders full of charisma who manage to enter the hearts of the crowd by their power of conviction. They choose the most insecure sectors and people to whom they inject large doses of false trust and dependence, and then use them in the propagation of their miserable revolution.2) From the beginning, they call a supposed self-identification and self-recognition through rhythmic and flattering slogans. They remember again and again their few and poor achievements that remain in the distant past. Then, they impose a barrier of differences between them and the supposed enemy. In this way, the people is infused with a nationalism that is based on ignorance, fear, and blind reverence, forcing them to repeat proverbs and apply reforms without understanding the true meaning or purpose, thus beginning to resemble a herd of sheep, marching pleased towards the slaughterhouse.3) They make the crowd believe that they have the final decision and, for the common good, unconsciously follow the rules and imposed parameters. In addition, some extra benefits are allowed to those who follow and protect the regime indulgently. This is how they teach the majority that it is better to be corrupt, dishonest, and negligent, in order to achieve higher ranks.4) The regime feel entitled to legalize and abolish what suits it, ordering the people what to eat, how to dress, greet and live, and what to learn, while they live freely at the expense of the efforts of others and of the injustices committed, trampling the honor of an entire country and their own Machiavellian socialist laws.5) What seemed a worthy plan for community, social, intellectual, and economic development, now shows the true intention that tries to kill the spirit of solidarity to impose the dictatorial and even genocidal plan, if the regressive revolution warrants it.6) Everyone, even the majority of the crowd, realize that revolutionary projects are a total failure when they find themselves amidst of aberrant poverty.7) When they want to discredit an opponent or other progressive ideas, they use their famous method of defamation with lies, intimidation, and any other means. For them, the aim (maintain / save the revolution) justifies the means (spreading false rumors, prosecutions, torture, hunger, espionage), importing in the least the opinion of others, since their own people live in ignorance, cowardice and/or conformism.8) To finally protect their interests and ideals, communists surround themselves with and associate with allies of their own class: corrupt, traffickers, murderers and terrorists, and expand their power further through the destruction of every vital block of a society , from its financial structure to public sectors, such as health, without caring about the misery that people live. To rule the ignorant and negligent is much easier.9) There comes a time when the revolutionary-communist doctrine is so deeply rooted in the consciences, that the people forget how well they lived before. The most outrageous thing is that there are still people who support such regimes and whose can mental programming is so easily influenced on behalf the sadistic needs and convenience of these cunning and malevolent rulers.Times before the Rebellion are being left in the past, where the memories struggle to keep them safe to share them with others",True,humor_entertainment,1

It is the total sum of these circumstances and the prudence and undying love of a wonderful mother that makes Trevor the man that he is today.My favorite chapter was “Hitler” It is the perfect screen shot of the alternate worlds Apartheid created; for black folks, anyone who was kicking the white man’s ass to the extent that the white man sought the help of the black man deserved veneration hence naming their kids, Hitler.

I know almost nothing about South Africa, and to be honest, I know very little about the continent of Africa.When you want to learn more about such complex worlds and ideas, it is difficult to pick a starting point. With so much history and nuance and complexities, it can be a bit overwhelming. So instead of trying to find a comprehensive overview of history throughout the past few centuries, sometimes it is good to simply find one person’s story.Trevor Noah’s story is outrageous. It is a prime example of truth being stranger than fiction. It is so hard to believe the stories you read are true.

2649,1982185821,5,The title of this book drew me in but then...,29 people found this helpful,To be honest I was not expecting much from this book. I had never heard of her before (I'm 58 yrs old) I  thought it would be another typical bad childhood/happy ending book. But I quickly changed my mind. She has been through literal hell both physically but especially mentally.  Her mom who I think she is still too easy on; where's the well-deserved anger?! was a monster with no redeeming qualities that I can discern of. She practically destroyed her. Reading the book made me hate her for what she put her daughter and sons through. Not to mention her unfortunately weak father who failed in his duty to protect them from her abuse. She has accomplished so much in searching and working hard to attain some semblance of mental wellness. And it seems she has achieved that.. She fought and tackled an enormous mountain that many are unable to accomplish. She is Brave. She is intelligent and funny besides that. I hope she knows that no one can achieve total happiness.  But it sounds like she is doing a damn good job of living her life. She has my very best wishes to have alot of peace and happiness in her life. I thank her for sharing herself with us. And I hope she makes alot of money on her book!,True,humor_entertainment,1

13704,1542046599,3,give this book a try as the story was interesting!,2 people found this helpful,"I Am Watching You by Teresa Driscoll is a mystery, thriller novel. The book is told in multiple points of view from the witness (Ella), the father (Henry), the friend (Sarah), and the private investigator (Matthew). Anna goes missing after taking a trip to London with her friend Sarah to go see Les Miserables. On the train they meet a couple of guys who were just released from prison. Overhearing the conversation, Ella feels uncomfortable for the girls but decides to stay out of the situation. After hearing the news of Anna’s disappearance she goes straight to the police to tell them what she heard on the train.A year later is when the story takes place. Anna is still missing and the family is getting ready to do an anniversary appeal to help get any new information. Ella, the witness, has been overwhelmed with guilt feeling as though this is partially her fault because she kept to herself and let the girls be. However, Ella's name was slipped to the media and now she has started to receive threatening letters in the mail accusing her of not helping. Sarah, the friend, feels as though this is her fault because she left Anna alone the night she disappeared and may have some inside knowledge on who may have known what happened to her. In order to give this information to the police, Sarah has to reveal a huge secret from her past but is she ready to admit to it? Henry, the father, had a big row with Anna right before she left but does his secret have anything to do with her disappearance? Matthew, the private investigator, is hired by Ella to help find out who is sending the letters but will he be the one to figure out what really happened to Anna?I Am Watching You by Teresa Driscoll was a successful novel but in a different way than imagined. From the description and title I was expecting a little more creepiness over the feeling of someone really watching Ella. Besides a few postcards and two incidents that happened at her flower shop, not much is touched on this subject. The majority of the book is trying to figure out what really happened the night Anna disappeared. I really enjoyed the different points of view because it brought fresh perspectives to the story as you continue to ask yourself what secrets are they holding on to? In the description on the book you are to assume that there would be more of this person “watching"" Ella and doing more to threaten her, or revealing that they know about Anna and what happened that night. From the novel you don't get much of this which was disappointing.Once you look past the disappointment of the main plot of the novel, the story and development were done well. I enjoyed trying to figure out what exactly happened to Anna that night and everybody's involvement. The story really does make you think, “What would you do?” Would you intervene if you were Ella on the train? Would you have revealed your secret if you were Sarah? Would you have lied to the police if you were Henry? All of these situations, the wondering, and the secrets kept me interested in the book.I give I Am Watching You by Teresa Driscoll 3 out of 5 stars. I was really disappointed with not having enough of the creepiness I was expecting of someone actually watching Ella and diving into that aspect of the book. The title and the description really had me wanting more than what was given. I did enjoy the story and the different points of view but felt it could have been a little stronger. I do recommend giving this book a try as the story was interesting!",True,mystery,0

This is not necessarily a journal, but it is like unique, fun writing prompts that help people that are clearly having a bad day let that sh*t go! I figured this would be a good outlet for her to channel her anger when she finds herself upset in there, as I know personally living with hundreds of other women, personalities are bound to clash at times! This would’ve been a more healthy way of getting out her feelings since she enjoys journaling and writing instead of getting into physical and verbal altercations. I know others will agree. It is truly a shame our prison system here in the United States will not allow the ladies to have a book like this for self help. Instead, it is as though they enable the violence rather than let these women have a funny, quirky, relatable book with writing prompts in it to journal about their feelings, etc. as I stated above, I am just very disappointed she could not have this book.

It's an upmarket romance between two writers. What could go wrong? When gloomy Gus and diehard optimist January meet, I knew I was in for a slow burn, starting from a negative square, romance. And I like a good amount of backstory, evocative descriptions and setting. I like knowing the WHY of how people behave. But for two twenty- or thirty-somethings who have had lonterm previously relationships, there turned out to be a lot of adolescent behavior. Aside from conversations about literature and writing, almost no real communication. Lots and lots of the heroine weeping over the fact that her deceased father had had a longterm affair, and she now hated him. And loads of backstory interrupting the present-day story. I wanted this to be a five-star upmarket romance read. I made myself finish it, but the characters by that point were so implausible in their behavior, there were so many long interruptions for backstory about the dead dad, that it was a grind to hit the end. The end actually had occurred many chapters earlier, but was unrealistically drawn out.",True,romance,0

2160,1451673310,3,Hmmm...,3 people found this helpful,"I'll start first by saying that this was my first experience with a Ray Bradbury novel. And after finishing it only a few hours ago after starting three days earlier, I'm not quite sure yet what to make of it as a whole. As far as entertainment goes, it's decent, I guess. And although it is a very short novel, reaching just beneath 160 pages, it's very, very long winded. It runs on at times to the point where it's almost incomprehensible, reading a few scenes twice to ensure that I understood exactly what had just happened.  Still, it's an interesting read and can be real vivid at times, in terms of painting a picture and also at meeting a level that measures up insanely close to our world we're living in today and how technology plays a large role in how we think, what we do, and what we're into with entertainment. And what makes the novel work in that aspect is that it seems to do all this without coming off as preachy or pretentious...or at least that's what I thought anyway.  It's not the most uplifting or pleasantly breezy read out there. But it is at least somewhat fascinating in a morbid way, and the thing about Bradbury's writing is that it seems to have real emotion underneath it all. You can tell that the writer (well hidden in the shadows of the tale, of course), really feels for the story and means what he's writing, whether or not he's aware of it when the story's playing out. And I think that that constitutes the three stars I'm giving it (me being the picky reader that I am).  Definitely worth a look.",True,humor_entertainment,0

They also happen to be enemies who went to school together.They spend the summer in a bet, seeing who can more successfully write in the other's genre. They of course get to know each other deeper throughout the summer, all while dealing with their own demons and finding themselves. Yes, the ending is predictable.

But then they went their separate ways and Elliot never heard back from Macy and now she's back in the picture again. I was eager to find out what happened between them and why Macy was so afraid to pick back up despite Elliot's eagerness. What did he do and what did she do? I couldn't fathom that Elliot did anything wrong from what I learned about him, but at the same time, I was on Macy's side because she had been through so much and needed someone in her corner. And if Elliot did hurt her, then he needed to apologize.

Back then I think I enjoyed the book as "" a book about burning books"" which, at the time, I was all about as I was tired of school and ready to graduate.Now as an adult, I come away from Fahrenheit 451 with an appreciation for the book on two counts. The first is the cautionary tale of succumbing to the almighty groupthink - the same one that seems to permeate our society irregardless of political or religious bent - working its way into the fabric of our lives one blink of an unblinking eye at a time. The second is just how much I love reading Bradbury's prose. The way he writes almost invites one to take pause and re-read certain passages again to savor the meaning and craftsmanship of a true verbal artist.If you are on a kick for reading those classic books from your school days, or are a young person looking for some stimulation from the writers who weaved their craft before the Kindle revolution, this book should satisfy that need to read and enjoy versus just consuming another product.

8964,887431453,5,I love the school zone books!,4 people found this helpful,"I have used these books with all 3 of my children and I have really loved them.  The books have changed throughout the years, but I have liked the changes.  The reason I like them is that the amount of writing is just right.  Kids can learn their colors, numbers and letters before they can write them.  I like that the book contains little writing and instead focuses on circling and a little bit of coloring.  I also like how the book is organized.  I pull one sheet from each color every time my son sits down to do the school work.  I also love the bright colors and pictures.  If a child does not know what a picture is than it is a good time to tell them what new things are.  My 3 yr old son begs to do school work.I started these books with all 3 of my kids at 3yrs old.  My 3 yr old son (who is almost 4) is now about 1/2 way through the kindergarten book.  All of my children seemed to have similiar pacing.  The transition between preschool and kind books are perfect.  As he has been able to do it all without struggling and little help (except reading the directions and covering new concepts).  I think the ages are not quite right though, but that does not really matter to me.  It is really geared for 3 to 4 yr olds and the kinder book should be finished before starting kindergarten as our kindergarten expects you to know everything in it.  After the kindergarten book there is a big gap which i am not sure how to fill (they need a transition between the Kinder and 1st grade book) as my son understands the concepts of reading and can sound out very simple words.  He is still a long way from reading fluently.  My other son is doing well in 1st grade and is just now finishing the 1st grade book.  The have made the kinder and preschool books more user friendly and actually easier, but along the way they jumped too much from one age level to the next.The preschool book is good for 3-4 yr oldsThe kindergarten book is good for 4-5 yr olds**School zone needs to make a book here!The 1st grade book is good for 6-7 yr olds",True,children,1

I first read ""1984"" in 1985 and now for the second time in 2018.  The book has remained the same, but both the world and I have not.  I cannot begin to convey how genuinely frightening this book is.  I am a lover of popular science fiction and am astounded by Orwell's ability to be more compelling, entertaining and engrossing than authors with the benefit of light sabers, phasers and teleportation.To every young person who has been assigned this book, know that you are reading a literary work of art.  Many of you will understand and appreciate it, but if you love literature, please make a mental note to read this again when you are older.  Youth brings with it eternal hope, boundless optimism and of course, hormones, so you will find yourself rebelling against the pessimism of the book itself - you will effectively be Winston raging against the machine, hoping, searching, questing for a way out.  In short, you will cheat.But when you get older, have a family, lose loved ones and see some of your dreams unfulfilled - when you witness entire nations and races of peoples born, live and die in brutal squalor - when you reflect on the technological advances made over the decades and gaze, with mouth agape, at how a people can be less advanced, less informed and less enlightened, not despite these innovations, but BECAUSE of them, then you will read 1984 as it was meant to be read...not as a dark, dystopian world you enter when you open the book, but a beautifully brutal warning that, even as you read it, is prophetically coming true around you.",True,humor_entertainment,1

147,451524934,5,A Classic for Today's World!,3 people found this helpful,"One of my favorite classics that I, even though it is very depressing, recommend anyone interested in reading to read this book.Set in a nightmarish London of 1984 – we see life in a totalitarian state through the eyes of a single character, Winston Smith, who dares to standup against the notorious – notorious in our world – Big Brother in his own ways, through little defiant acts, such as keeping a journal stating his disapproval with his world and the government, to sneaking off and having sex with a woman for pleasure which is looked down upon as sex is only seen as a necessary for procreation.In this world, Freedom was only attained through total obedience to the Party, and the love of Big Brother, who watched you at all times.  Winston works as a functionary of the Ministry of Truth where history is rewritten to favor the Party’s line summed up beautifully by the Party’s slogan ""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.""  A little at a time Winston begins to realize that things are not as they should be and that those things should be changed.  This book is drowned in hopelessness, but it is something we all need to read and keep close to our hearts, because during these troubling times it is too easy to forget how easy it is to fall into the trap that leads to Socialism to Communism to Totalitarianism.With today’s technology, Big Brother is a real threat and with the Government growing larger and larger the world of 1984 can become our future – if we are not careful.",True,humor_entertainment,1

16648,1984806734,4,Deserves the hype,,"It’s pretty rare that I say this about a popular book, but Beach Read totally deserves all the hype it’s been getting. I loved it!I did find that I had to adjust my expectations when I started the book. I expected a tropical location and nothing but cuteness. However, the beach being referenced in the title is on Lake Michigan and there was a whole lot of seriousness and emotional punches mixed in with the cuteness. That ended up working for me, though. I really loved both January and Gus and thought they were relatable and likable characters. I thought they brought out the best in each other and were a great example of how a couple should grow together in a relationship and not just be “fixed” by love.I loved January and Gus’ banter. They made me smile throughout so much of this book and there were so many cute and romantic moments between them. They also managed to make me emotional, as well. I thought Gus’ general pessimism was relatable, while also wanting to see him find happiness and heal from his awful childhood. January is not only dealing with the grief of her father’s passing, but she has also found out that he had cheated on her mother and is left wondering how much of her childhood was a lie because of it. I, personally, also found this very relatable. There were several things she tried to work through which I found pretty cathartic and I liked that while she came to terms with things, she didn’t necessarily get the closure she wanted on it, either. It felt real.I also loved that both main characters are authors. Books about authors or journalists are my weakness. I liked reading about what they thought about different genres and their daily writing routines and dealing with writer’s block. I also wanted to read the books they were writing, especially Gus’ cult book.Overall, I really loved Beach Read and this little review probably doesn’t do justice to how much. I loved the characters and the town (once I got over it not being a tropical beach location, I found the small town charming, even if it is in Michigan (I’m a Buckeye)) and the emotions and the romance. It was a perfect blend of serious and cute and I couldn’t get enough of it. I definitely recommend this one!Overall Review (out of 5): 4 Stars",False,romance,1

It might not make sense, but I feel like it tries really hard yet nurses the wrong wounds. I’m all for peppered language, but the profanity in parts is incredibly forced and does not flow well or artfully as I’d expect from a book with this title. I hoped for more ACT based activities, but this skirts over any frustrations you may have to work through and instead suggests writing things you can do to cheer yourself up. Step 1; you should be acknowledging your own personal experiences good or bad. Skipping step 1 and leaping all the way to step 10; “now that your healed, let’s do something irrelevant!” Just doesn’t work. It might suit some very well, to which I nod respectfully.

The two hit it off and kept running into each other until they had no choice but to acknowledge their attraction and lay down the ground rules.When I read The Wedding Date, I fell in love with the push and pull of the relationship and the commentary on the challenges of interracial dating. The Proposal was a bit more light-hearted and was missing the emotional appeal that The Wedding Date had. At the end of the day, The Proposal was cute and the ending put a smile on my face.Characters:  Nik was a woman I desperately wanted to learn more about and I felt that The Proposal barely scratched the surface. It was clear that she had trust issues and had been hurt badly in the past, but we never delved into what made Nik tick. In fact, Nik's friends kind of stole the show and I hope that Guillory decides to write another book that features Nik's best gal pals. Carlos was just as sweet as he was in The Wedding Date with a bit more stress. In The Proposal, we learned about his relationship with his family and the burden that he carried. It was good to see Carlos play the leading man and I loved how emotional he was.Worldbuilding: While The Wedding Date took place in the Bay Area, The Proposal explored the L.A. area.

My issue is the make of the book. This is obviously a book for toddlers and it is described as a board book. However, board books have thicker, CARDBOARD (hence the BOARD in board book) pages that are easier for little hands to turn. This anniversary edition has durable pages that are laminated and thicker that standard children’s books, but they are much thinner than typical board book pages and thus more difficult for toddlers to manipulate. I don’t like it. I have noticed other publishers going this way with their board books as well and I don’t understand it.",True,children,0
163,451524934,5,This classic was not meant to be a guidebook!,,"George Orwell  was spot on when it came to the desires of Authoritarian ""communist"" regimes.  Although written in 1949  the dystopian nightmare described within  remains as a highly relevant as the day it was written and  the predictions it made as stark warnings don't fall very short of  the reality it predicted. Every citizen of the world should read books like 1984 and be weary of their own futures and realities.",True,humor_entertainment,1

18062,399587683,4,Crazy Love,,"I really enjoyed this gem. The characters were so great. Their love story was crazy. The way they met, the connection the characters had. Loved all of it. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel the story kind of dropped at the end. I understand that the story had to end however, I would’ve liked a little more to round these beautiful characters off and wrap a nice bow around them. A perfectly good read.",True,romance,1
