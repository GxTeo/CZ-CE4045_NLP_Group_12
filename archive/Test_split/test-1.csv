I'm a family therapist, so I'm very choosy about the messages in children's books, and I was impressed!  The sentiment of the book is expressed though the voice of the adult story-reader who can't wait to see what wonderful things the child does and becomes.  It's a book meant to be read to a baby or young child, by a relative or close family friend, or perhaps a teacher.  It's not really the type of story book that's meant for a young child to read to himself or herself, but that's ok, because it's so perfect for the intended purpose.  Love it!","True","children"

It is definitely worth getting especially if you struggle with things internally. Definitely makes you stop and really think about past, present and future things.

"16790","1984806734","5","Laugh out loud funny & gripping romance","One person found this helpful","Reeling from her beloved father's death and the secrets revealed at his funeral, January reluctantly moves into a beautiful house on the lake she didn't know her father owned. She's suffering from writer's block and a myriad of emotions regarding her father, only to find her writing nemesis, Gus Everett, lives next door.I *loved* this book. I read it in two great chunks - it probably would have been one, but alas, I must work. The beginning made me laugh out loud, it was so funny. But as soon as Henry starts digging deeper into January and Gus' emotions and what has happened in their lives to get them where they are, things take a more serious turn. It's also where the romance truly takes off, because they're FINALLY getting to know one another as they really are, and that means opening up about their struggles.I genuinely like January and Gus as characters, which isn't always the case with romance novels. I was rooting for them and their happy ending *so hard*. While I read these books for the happy ending, it's rare that I get so terribly invested in the romance of two characters. I would honestly read another book that's just Gus and January's domestic life together, because I really want them to be happy.It's well written and an absorbing read. For me, it was one of those books where you blink and it's 2 hours later and you really have to use the bathroom. I'll definitely reread this.","True","romance"

"845","B01IW9TM5O","5","there is absolutely nothing funny about the impact that colonialism and apartheid had and ...","3 people found this helpful","Although the author of ""Born a Crime"" is a world-renowned comedian, there is absolutely nothing funny about the impact that colonialism and apartheid had and STILL have on South Africa today. Trevor Noah masterfully reminds us of how hatred became the norm during apartheid (or, more adequately, 'apart hate).  Through a system of institutionalized racism, people were separated and classified which led to a greater division in the country.Trevor Noah's quirky perspective on life lightens the tone of what is a tragic story of a country destroyed by hate. His life is spent in a sort of limbo because he is neither black nor white, but colored, which during the system was illegal. ""While most children are a symbol of their parents love, I was a sign of their criminality""  Whites did not view the blacks as  humans, and the coloreds were symbols of blatant disrespect to white authority. According to the authorities, race-mixing was more serious than treason because instead of separating the races, it shows that races want and can mix together--the ultimate betrayal to a system that has spent so much time brainwashing a society to abide by the laws of institutionalized racism.""Born a Crime"" is the story of Noah's quest to fit in, to find a place in society, and his mischievous nature leads him to become immersed in petty crime. He is first introduced to this inner ""animal instinct"" when he is thrown out of a moving car (by his mother) in an effort to save his life.  But, before you judge, remember, his existence was considered a crime due, so his mother acted quickly to protect his life. Throughout his youth, Trevor spends so much time dodging police officers solely for the crime of being born the wrong color. (However, there are quite a few comical moments when Trevor finds himself involved in innocent scams that lead to high speed chases on foot.  As he so eloquently reminds the reader, ""It is easy to be judgmental about crime when you live in a world wealthy enough to be removed from it."" He reminds us that it is only by breaking down barriers that we can truly begin to understand.Don't let Noah's use of humor fool you; ""Born a Crime"" is an essential read for anyone who wants to learn more about apartheid and life in South Africa. Trevor Noah's book is powerful because he masterfully helps the reader understand the humanity of those victimized by the system of apartheid, a critical that so many history books lack. I look forward to reading more works from this author in the future.","True","humor_entertainment"

"17840","399587683","4","Delightful Rom-Com!","","This was my first book of Guillory‚Äôs and I found it to be a delightful rom-com which was just what I needed in the midst of thriller and serial killer books! When Nik is proposed to on the Jumbotron at a baseball game, it‚Äôs an understatement to say she is shocked - she definitely did not see more than friends with benefits with wannabe actor Fisher - and when she turns him down, he doesn‚Äôt take it well. Cue onlooker Carlos who steps in and saves Nik from the swarm of parasites.... now given that I mentioned this is a romantic comedy, of course Nik & Carlos begin to fall for each other - but not without obstacles. The Proposal was definitely a tad predictable but sometimes that‚Äôs what you want from this genre of book and that was okay with me! I enjoyed some of the side plots like Courtney the cup cake baker badass and the girls signing up for self defense classes as well. I‚Äôd definitely be interested in checking out more from Guillory in the future!I received an advance copy. All opinions are my own.","False","romance"

"15096","1984806734","4","It was fun and made me laugh, but it also had some great serious and thoughtful moments.","","This new release has been hyped all over the internet. I was interested immediately from the synopsis. A book about a writer that‚Äôs stuck? Count me in.We follow January, a romance writer who has learned some things about her parents that have shaken her idea of happily ever after. She‚Äôs moved into a beach house that she didn‚Äôt know her father owned so she can pack it up and sell it. This is a hugely emotional thing for her, but at the same time, she‚Äôs supposed to be writing her next book by the end of the summer. The only problem with this is that she hasn‚Äôt even started and when she tries, she has no ideas. Things get interesting when she realizes who her neighbor is.Augustus Everett is a fellow writer, one that January actually went to college with. I really liked him from the start. It was immediately clear that these two had certain assumptions about one another that weren‚Äôt really true. So, Gus and January make a deal where Gus will spend the summer writing a romance novel and January will write literary fiction. I loved that this became sort of cathartic for January. She used this new challenge to try to work through all of the things she has going on in her life. I just really enjoyed the writing aspects of the story. I also totally loved the flirtation that was included for some of the writing parts. Also, as a part of their deal, the two adventured together. Friday nights they would go somewhere that Gus had previously planned for book research and January would take Gus on field trips that one might find in a romance novel. I loved these because they were both so different. So, Fridays they‚Äôd deal with some really heavy stuff and Saturdays they would go to the carnival or something. It was an interesting contrast; the darkness of what Gus was researching with the fun date-like adventures that January planned.Overall, I really enjoyed this book just as much as everyone else. It was fun and made me laugh, but it also had some great serious and thoughtful moments. I found myself easily invested in the characters and their relationships. I will definitely be reading Emily Henry‚Äôs next adult romance.","False","romance"

I go way, way back when it comes to this author, back to a book called Beautiful Bastard where I met Bennett, it was love at first read. Since then I have read many books from Ms. Lauren and adore her books because of the incredible way she writes them.This book is no different, as a matter of fact (I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm typing this) this book is almost right up there to my adoration and love for Bennett. In this book, Elliott captured my heart rather quickly. This is a love story that has so much depth, you want to teleport yourself into this world and be a part of all the action. It‚Äôs a complicated story that goes from past to present and back to past again. Reading these types of book always allows me to think even more, I did a lot of thinking while reading. When you read this book and are introduced to these characters, get ready to take an astonishing ride of your reading life.What was it that kept me thinking the whole time??That‚Äôs easy, this isn‚Äôt just your simple love story read.It‚Äôs about jumping off into the water and praying you stay afloat. Macy and Elliott are the star characters that are treading water. They share a past, a very intriguing past that leads them to this point where these characters are at an impasse in present day. Do they sink or swim in the end - the question that I honestly kept trying to figure out because during so much of this book I kept trying to predict the rest of the story, as I was reading it!! I never came to the conclusion that I received when I finished it, just trust me when I say, the book was far better than any prediction I came up with.So a big YES to recommending this book to all - thank you Christina Lauren for taking me away once again from everyday stress and inviting me into your world of awesome!

That was a HORRIBLE mistake. It was truly one of the worst books I‚Äôve ever read in my entire life. I only finished it so I could properly write a review to save other people form making the same mistake I did.First of all, the dialogue (both internal and external) was horribly written. The characters both thought and spoke in ways that real people do not. Besides the dialogue, the rest of the book was just as poorly written. There were so many paragraphs that did nothing to help the story at all that could have been just left out entirely. Take the part at the end where the ex comes to Nik‚Äôs door and she punches him. It was incredibly random and just so terribly written it was almost laughable.  Additionally, the plot was not only predictable but incredibly boring.

"1798","786965606","5","Like many reviewers here","9 people found this helpful","Like many reviewers here, I'm one of the old-timers who started playing AD&D 1st edition back in the dark ages of 1981 or so and played the game extensively as both a player and a DM for many years.  I had invested so much in the 1st edition books, modules, etc. that I was frankly never interested in the subsequent editions.  Fast forward to 2017.  I hadn't played D&D in a number of years and a group of like-minded co-workers who had previous experience with various iterations of the game decided that we would like to get a gaming group together.  After more than a year of talking about doing it without actually doing it, I finally took the bull by the horns and said ""OK, here's the date and time at my house.  Let's stop talking about playing and just play.""  I decided to buy both the 5e Starter Set and this new Player's Handbook to see what had become of my beloved game.  Bottom line, I think Wizards of the Coast has absolutely knocked it out of the park.  For me, all the feel of the original edition is here, but with a much more organized, coherent and logical rules structure.  Combat, the magic system, treasure, artifacts, most everything is here from the 1st edition (including Unearthed Arcana) and more, but with a much more playable rules system and a lot of the deadwood cut away (I mean who the heck ever used things like the Unearthed Arcana cantrip ""Freshen"" for crying out loud?)  If you're still a 1st edition purist, skeptical like I was, at LEAST get the Start Set and give it a read through.  It won't take you more than an hour to wrap your head around the core of the new rules and I promise you, you WILL want to buy the Player's Handbook and delve more completely into the new edition.  Now when I go back and compare to the original PHB, the improvements are obvious and the overall design and production quality of the new book is manifestly evident.  Gone are the myriad of various tables and arbitrary rules for every little thing and instead a simple, easy-to-apply set of rules. largely based on the d20 roll that really cuts back on time at the gaming table spent paging through the book trying to figure out ""how do I do this?"" and put your time back where it belongs:  in the world of adventure.  Our newly-formed group has already played two marathon sessions in our first campaign and we are set for another session soon.  The bug has bitten and we are all freshly resurrected hard-core D&D players again.  My experience with this new edition and my new group has already resulted in the purchase 4 or 5 more new Player's Handbooks among the members of my gaming group.  Is 5th edition perfect?  Certainly not, but no system is and as Gary Gygax himself would no doubt say, the rules are in the end just guides, not graven in stone.  If something doesn't work for your group, change it up.  Fortunately with 5th edition, rare is the time so far I've done that and I'm blessed with a group of 7 excellent players who are NOT dreaded ""rules lawyers"" anyway.  AWESOME JOB Wizards of the Coast and keep the new 5e content coming!!","True","humor_entertainment"

A lot was happening but he would just disappear. Take a phone call and again disappear with no explanation. See my ex wife to have a conversation and just disappear again. Sorry but broken or not that would tick me off. It‚Äôs like saying I love you but I need to do this for myself k? I also didn‚Äôt like how we just skipped right into their chemistry.

"2190","1451673310","4","A classic for a reason","5 people found this helpful","Damn, what a rush this book was. I went into this novel hearing all the hype about how great it is and the great debate around the book‚Äôs central theme and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Fahrenheit 451 to me wasn‚Äôt merely about censorship or the soul sucking effects of the ‚Äúidiot box.‚Äù To me, Fahrenheit 451 is also a story about willful ignorance. A future world where everyone is content to waste their lives away in front of a television screen, to never think, to never be challenged, and to never give a second thought to their fellow man. It isn‚Äôt just books that the citizens of the future are no longer interested in ‚Äì folks don‚Äôt seem to be all that interested in anything. The character I found most interesting was Mildred ‚Äì she and the other wives are like little clucking hens that sit around the house all day. They are shining examples of what the world had become: apathetic and self absorbed. They lived within their own echo chambers and willingly ignored the terrible things going on around them.Although the central message of this book has done well to stand the test of time even to the present day, I will note that several elements of the story felt like they are becoming quite dated. The obvious absence of the internet, the fears of nuclear war, and of course the wives that never work being the social norm. It‚Äôs clear that the book was written during the Cold War era, so it might make things seem a little bit odd for younger audiences.I had some difficulty with the narration, primarily Guy Montag‚Äôs thoughts which to me seemed nonsensical or incoherent at times, but I figured that was intentional given the setting. The plot flew by so quickly and by the end I felt like I had whiplash. The story has a pretty even flow and then‚Ä¶ BOOM. The story suddenly speeds up and dives into an action packed ending. Despite my issues, the book still hits hard and gave me a lot to think about. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and had a difficult time putting it down.","True","humor_entertainment"

"1000","B01IW9TM5O","5","Both sides now","4 people found this helpful","This is an important and powerful book. The later portions provide interesting stories about finding his way during the transition from an apartheid where there was no place for him to a post-apartheid country where no one knew their place. But the real power is in the early chapters that lay the foundation for his dissociation. Trevor Noah writes about racial oppression and white privilege with an honesty and insight available only to someone who not only has experienced both but has experienced being whipsawed back and forth between them by a system that had no place to put him.South Africa must have some pretty solid statutes of limitation. In this book Noah freely admits to crimes from shoplifting to recording piracy. But when your very existence is a crime worse than murder, you don't sweat the small stuff.In one chapter, he talks about the genius of apartheid and how the ability to move up from Black to Colored to White kept everyone off balance and at one another's throats. I would tend to think of it as an uninteded effect of the insane logic of thinking you can classify everyone. But Noah helped me see that it was much more intentional and sinister than I gave it credit for. When I read poetry that has a possible interpretation beyond the surface meaning, I always give the poet the benefit of the doubt that it was done intentionally. Trevor Noah has forced me to do the same for the architects of apartheid.","True","humor_entertainment"

I love the back to basic character classes. No more needing an 8 page character sheet with 20 skill sets just to be able to sit at a table and pick up a fork to eat with. This is how I have wanted a new edition of DnD to bee since 2nd ed. Even though the player classes are basic they still give you the ability to make a character you will love. I love the races they added since 2nd Ed, but always hated the 3rd and 4th ed rule sets. Now I can have my new races and great character generation together for once. If you are a fan of the 2nd ed DnD, then I think you will instantly love this new Ed. If you liked micro-managed MIN/MAX characters of the past editions you are going to hate this one OR you may find it liberating! I found this refreshing and the new characters insanely fun to play.

"15740","1984806734","5","A Must Read for this Summer!!!","","Oh my dear God, this book! For starters, BEACH READ, in my opinion, is NOT a beach read at all. It‚Äôs nothing like a fluffy, swoon-worthy, super light and fun summer read like I expected (or as the title and cover implied); instead, it‚Äôs a book about sad, tragic pasts, ugly lies, and dirty family secrets.That being said, I really appreciate that there's much more depth in the character development and overall plot design. The protagonists, January and Gus, are determined to find their ways back to their truest selves through a string of bad lucks, terrible incidents, and harsh truths they're left no choice but to accept. Interestingly, as a rom-com and general fiction author respectively, January and Gus make a deal challenge each other to jump out of their comfort zones by switching their genres and each of them have to write a book in the genre they're most unfamiliar with. In short, January has to write a general fiction book instead of her favorite happily-ever-after whereas Gus needs to brainstorm a heartfelt, swoon-worthy story filled with pink bubbles. *giggles*Needless to say, this book is indeed a breath of fresh air with such an original story idea and unforgettable characters. January and Gus are both so different yet share a wicked sense of humor I can't get enough of. On a cooler note, the initial inspiration of this book is actually from Emily Henry's experience of a writer's block! In the acknowledgement, Emily reveals that since she has no idea what to write in the first place, why not write about the struggle of a writer's block? And I'm in awe, seriously, because this book turns out to be one of the BEST READS I've had this year so far!The story itself is on point and perfectly written, however, the only complaint I have for this book is the cover and book title. Not only are they utterly irrelevant to the storyline, there's no way I'd pick this book up had I judged it by its cover. Thankfully, the synopsis piques my curiosity more than the odd cover/title and I'm so, so, so happy I come across this book. :DAll in all, HIGHLY RECOMMEND Beach Read to all of you!! I'm sure you'll love January and Gus's writing/living journey as much as I do. This book truly far exceeds my expectation and I can't recommend it enough! If you ever got a chance to read it, please let me know what you think. I'd love to have someone to chat about this beautiful story. *wink*","False","romance"

It looks at their struggle to take over and operate the farm where they live and the opposition that they face from an oppressive master and a hostile world.But as you know, Animal Farm is also a harsh political satire. Its target is not socialism per se (George Orwell was a committed socialist). The target is authoritarian (and populist?) government in general, and the Soviet Union in particular. Orwell took a lot of heat for his criticism of the USSR but, of course, history has shown him to be right. I think that this book remains quite relevant to today's readers in today's world.

She takes some time off to get inspired and write, visiting a beach town and her father's old place. Enter Augustus Everett, yet another author, who January has actually had a prior acquaintance with in college. When they meet, they decide to strike up a deal to help one another with their writing blocks.This book was such a hilarious rom-com! I enjoyed it so much and was definitely reaching for tissues to wipe my tears of laughter away at a point or two and let it be known, it takes a lot to make me laugh. I absolutely loved Gus‚Äìhe was such an intriguing character who made me laugh and cry at the same time.Both characters struggle with a lot of internal difficulties from various relationships in their life but as they embark on different research adventures together, it's hard not to notice the undeniable pull between them. Picking up on strings left off years ago definitely is not easy, and neither is their relationship, but it's described in such a beautiful way that you can't help but root for these two all the way until the end.This story is told from just January's perspective, and while I usually am a fan of dual POV, this kept my attention the whole time and I didn't feel that having only one perspective took away from the story in any way. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a light-hearted fun read, though there is a touch of angst mixed in.","False","romance"

Carlos and his sister witness the whole proposal from a few rows up and quickly swoop in to rescue Nikole from the approaching camera crew. Away from the stadium and a few laughs/drinks later, a spark between Nikole and Carlos begins, leaving them both wishing for more time together.I love books where two people are obviously in love but refuse to see it themselves. Nikole and Carlos were both very likable characters and I found myself equally rooting for each. I loved that this story is about a mixed-race couple surrounded by a multiethnic cast. The enchilada scene was so fun and the CUPCAKES‚Ä¶can we talk about the cupcakes?! Obvious after reading about a gourmet cupcake shop, I had to go out and get myself a half dozen from a local place,  @cupcakeroyale .This is the second novel I have read by Guillory from her ‚ÄúWedding Date‚Äù series, but you can easily read this book as a stand-alone. Carlos actually appears as the supportive best friend in the first book, so I loved how this was an entirely new storyline separate from Drew and Alexa‚Äôs story, but still loosely connected.This had girl power, spunk, and body positive messages for women, while allowing space for male characters to show their feelings. All in all, this was a really easy and fun audiobook to listen to.","False","romance"

A ROMCOM WAITING TO HAPPEN...January is a hopeless romantic who narrates her life like she's the lead in a blockbuster movie.Gus is a serious literary type who thinks true love is a fairy-tale.But January and Gus have more in common than you'd think:They're both broke.They've got crippling writer's block.And they need to write bestsellers before summer ends.The result? A bet to swap genres and see who gets published first.The risk? In telling each other's stories, their worlds might be changed entirely‚Ä¶The Beach Read is written in 1st person with January being our narrator. The style of writing is easy to get on with and the chapters average about 10 pages each - so they aren't that long. The book deals with a lot of issues, such as grief, infidelity, divorce, love etc. So much so, that I don't think it's a typical rom com book, this book felt much more real than that. There is also no fade to black on the sex scenes, which were detailed.I enjoyed this book. I loved the characters of January and Gus and they were very realistic and relatable to me. I enjoyed reading about how they both wrote, what inspired them and why they wrote. I enjoyed the journey January went on too, it felt, again, very realistic and I was very pleased with the ending.There wasn't really much I didn't like about this book. Other than it was quite different from how it was advertised. It was really a beach read, it also wasn't really light hearted in my opinion as it dealt with very serious and often upsetting issues.But, I did enjoy the story for what it was.

But, English authors tend to flesh out the characters first whereas Americans like things to rush along, getting to the action. This book is not an action thriller, it's much richer because the author has given the reader people to care about, some that are kind, some petty, some mysterious and she weaves her murder mystery among these characters with a well-written tapestry of English settings. I really enjoyed getting to see everything coming together to solve an intricate and emotional case. I found that it was a good idea to keep a running list of each introduced person as each chapter is dedicated to one person or scene, each important but not apparently so. To sum up, this was a worthwhile story that's not horror or full of graphic language. I did get a kick out of the English slang.

I understand use of profanity is part of making the characters realistic, but I think the character development would have happened without so much colorful language.  I usually like books employing a back and forth in time style; however, I often had difficulty telling when certain events took place.  The past and present  events seemed to jump all over the place on a single page or within the same paragraph.  It is a book selection for our book club later in the year.  I am afraid at least one member will not read the book past the first few pages due to the language.  Others will read it for the discussion value as we compare it to our own experiences in the American South and the differences in American regional racial attitudes.  Our group is neither  ethnically nor gender diverse, though several grew up in different areas of the country, greatly affecting perception and personal experiences.  It would be interesting to hear a male perspective.  Trevor's mother was hard for me to relate to as I saw her as a compilation of contradictions.  That may have been the author's point as he attempted to paint a picture of her for the reader. I do believe the book club group will be critical of the writing style and its general lack of flow or transition. I have a friend who lived in South Africa for many years.  I feel her stories (though from a Caucasian female point of view) gave me a better understanding of the strict laws and cultural norms of the time, The best part of the story for me is the thought provoking, attention getting title.","True","humor_entertainment"

One reviewer I saw actually referred to this trio as the Holy Trinity of dystopian literature. I like the comparison, because I really like all three. But I find it difficult to imagine a Holy Trinity of dystopia without The Stand in there. I guess it depends on your definition though. Maybe The Stand is more ""apocalyptic"" than dystopian.Anyway, I read The Gulag Archipelago last year, and Volume One thoroughly detailed the practices of the Soviet Union in the days following the Revolution. Many of the practices of the government of Oceania (the fictional superpower under whose boot the protagonist, Winston Smith, lives) remind me of the descriptions given by Solzhinytsyn of the Soviet Union. For example, Oceania had programs where children were taught to snitch on their parents if they spoke poorly of the state. There was also the concept of strictly controlling the flow of information. One of the things I'll never forget from The Gulag Archipelago is the torture techniques used by the Soviet prison guards. They would crush men's testicles among other terrible acts that I don't even want to think about. This is common practice in Oceania as well. It's interesting just how much Orwell understood the inner-workings of the Soviet Union even when other parts of the world were still in denial about what they were up to over there.It's a sad ending. You just want to see Winston hold up to the torture, but he doesn't. Then when he's released, you just want to see him track down his girlfriend and run off to the wilderness somewhere and live the rest of their lives together in solitude, but they don't. In the end, they're both broken and become servants of the state. In the end, Winston does everything that is asked of him and he's still shot in the head.","True","humor_entertainment"

I started with 1.0 and 1.5 books as a kid then got into 3.5 as a teenager. Now as an adult i am trying out 5.0. I like the fact that the 5.0 books return to a bit more streamlined way of playing, much like 1.5. I don't like that the classes are so much more overpowered and restricted. You can't make a bad character, not really. You can't mix and match and customize as much as 3.5 but 3.5 and pathfinder both went a bit crazy with all the subsets and extra rules. I found this player's handbook to be a bit sparse on fun stuff and it involves a lot of back and forthing when setting up a character.That being said, once you make your character the book is well laid out and easy to use. I do like how the spell lists are arranged not only alphabetically by class but also by spell in general. Much preferable to the clunkier model used by 3.5.Packaging was fine. Delivery guy put it somewhere safe but still noticeable if you live here. Book is in perfect condition.It gets a 5 i suppose because it does exactly what it should and i can't blame the book for it's creators evolution of an idea.Still miss my 1.0 lol.","True","humor_entertainment"

"89","451524934","4","Great Novel....Not the Greatest eBook","","Nineteen Eighty-Four is one of Orwell's most famous and most chilling novels and a thoroughly good read. If you're reading these reviews then chances are you know the plot or the book and don't need it retold here, so I wont.I WILL, however mention that while the story is amazing, the eBook is not great. There are images throughout along the lines of 'You free PDF-extractor trial has expired' or 'Thank you for using PDF-converter' or whatever program it is. This is mildly frustrating but I am unable to tell if it actually interrupts the story or if there are parts missing. There are also plenty of chapter titles missing but as I have never read a physical copy of the book it is entirely likely that that is simply how Orwell intended for the book to be, in line with the running themes of the novel.All of that aside, for the price that I paid for the eBook and the convenience afforded to me by my Kindle...I'm not overly fussed.

"13621","1542046599","1","More gripes than hypes","One person found this helpful","This is the first book I‚Äôve read by this author and thought I would roll the dice and give her a try.  The first thing that bothered me was that the story felt choppy. Not just because there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a very clear main character to follow or that you are following several people at once from different perspectives but also because each chapter ends in a  cliff hanger leaving the reader unsatisfied throughout the whole book. As a result of the writing style I didn‚Äôt feel connected to any of the characters at all. You do get the whole story but end up having to piece the bits together to end up with a coherent picture. Like making a shirt from 5 different materials. The majority of the book is spent detailing dead end story lines with no payout to the reader. The book pretty much ends in the middle of an action scene in a cliff hanger.  The epilogue does wrap up some questions but doesn‚Äôt even really address all the characters you spend the whole book following. The epilogue seemed like a rushed afterthought to answer questions and give info that would have been better served actually being addressed in the plot. One of my biggest gripes about this book is definitely how the female characters were all portrayed. For some reason (and surprisingly so because it is a female author) all the female characters come off as feeble, emotionally unstable and lash out or act strictly on impulse. Not to have a reasonable normal female character was a thorn in my side. The friend, the sister, the mother, the witness, even the female DI lashes out at her coworker and is put on suspension (even if it‚Äôs only mentioned in passing). The whole book was utterly disappointing. My last gripe is that the author tends to drawl on about flies and farm life and flowers which have nothing to offer the book except act as page filler. It‚Äôs a waste really because the bones of a good story are there but it‚Äôs a bit like watching a person waste their talent.","True","mystery"

It's WAY overly wordy though and makes simple concepts like how to calculate rolls much more complicated than a simple google search will explain.PROS:Artwork is pretty awesome, and gets the creative juices goingClear and thorough outline of player classesCONS:Player race descriptions are very brief. In a book with over 300 pages, most classes have only 2-3 pages dedicated (including illustrations)The explanation of gameplay mechanics is VERY scattered and difficult to piece together. I am constantly looking in the index and running through 4-5 chapters to get a full explanation of most concepts.Could be much more concise, and therefore, much shorter.There is no simple approach for this book... it's ""Read it all... then read it all again... then understand it""... there isn't a way to read through it in a way that gets you started in a simplified way, or a way to read the concepts as you'd approach them in the game.OVERALL:As I said it's basically a necessity, especially if you are interested in how to build a character and or interested in the classes that the starter set does not cover. It is difficult to approach for a new player and has the concepts (like calculating AC, or when that calculation is to be applied) are either scattered so much it takes a quest to find them, or may just not be present at all.

"1007","B01IW9TM5O","5","Angela's Ashes in South Africa","One person found this helpful","What an amazing story! Trevor Noah, who replaced Jon Stewart as late night host, has told the story of his growing up years in South Afica. Let me just say, it is an incredible story! Each chapter recounts an episode or a time in his life. Not knowing much about South Africa, I learned a great deal about apartheid, and the adjustment that followed when it was dismissed. I learned about the racism, the poverty, the different languages, tribes and cultures. I learned about life threatening violence, and about why Trevor's title is so apt.But, all of this is told very truthfully, but with a forgiving spirit, sprinkled with humor, as the droll Noah does in his comedy routines. There is disappointment , disagreement, mischief, rage and the most intense pain one could feel. All is well written and well explained. There is emotion, history, the journey to adulthood, the family spirit, and even religious experience. The time toured in this memoir of a young boy growing up in South Africa, contrasts what readers in the US may have experienced growing up, with Noah's very different experience. However, there is the thread of common human experience, so well woven throughout.In short, this is a very worthy book which I highly recommend. If you haven't seen Trevor Noah, do tune in to his show and or check him out on You Tube. The book, the tv show, and any videos of him, will amaze you, once you have learned his story. Absolutely, this is on my list as one of the best reads of 2017!","True","humor_entertainment"

The other review that discusses the choppy sentences and how they affect the flow of the book was spot on. There were other minor grammatical (stylistic?) issues that bothered me: using single quotations for conversations instead of double quotations and missing periods after abbreviations. It just seemed like a lack of attention to detail. The story culminated in the least gripping scene I've read in a mystery/thriller, like the author was rushing to get it over with. There were subplots that took up half of chapters that still don't seem relevant to the story. Each chapter was from a different character's perspective, and more and more characters were the star of their own chapter, which was odd. Overall, it felt like the author took a short story and stretched it out into a novel. A novel with choppy, stream of consciousness sentences, random subplots, and cliffhangers at the end of every chapter. Normally, I'm filled with a sense of emptiness at having finished a book, but right now I'm filled with relief.","True","mystery"

Incredibly interesting about how he never felt he fit in with any group - not black, or white, or even mixed, and how he would make himself fit in where he needed to. This book is also an amazing tribute to his mother, and to a lesser extent, his father.I love how he tells enough detail that the reader understands how bad it was, but isn‚Äôt so heavy that the book becomes hard to read.

I appreciate that there was a lot of diversity among the characters and each one had a unique personality quirk that brought life to the story.
