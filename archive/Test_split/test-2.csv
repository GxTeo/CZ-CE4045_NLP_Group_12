However, the book I received was printed backward and upside down.  The cover of the book is actually the back of the book and the text forces me to have the book upside down.

As for 5th edition it's been pretty easy to follow so far. Based on what I've experienced and what I've heard 5e is a great place to start if you're a beginner like myself. As for the book the pages are well organized with wonderful pieces of art to help inspire any would be adventurer. The only real problem with it is the spine makes a creaking sound whenever I open it up, and based on what I've seen this probably more than a few pages may fall out over time due to overuse.","True","humor_entertainment"
"2396","1451673310","4","You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.","14 people found this helpful","My Rating: Put it on your list Level: Quick and easy read, fairly short. SummaryAway in the dark near future, there is a still a profession called 'fireman', but they don't save houses from burning (houses are fireproof now), but now they start fires. Not for houses, but for books. The book follows the story of one of these firemen as he starts to question why they are doing what they do, and instead starts saving and hiding books. After he is found out, he becomes the victim of the system he used to be a part of. My ThoughtsThis is a classic of dystopian fiction. The scary thing is, though some elements are over the top, much is too accurate. Bradburry rightly predicts (originally published in 1951) that books won't be banned by the government or people in the majority for challenging the status quo, but instead, books will be questioned or banned for offending some group or another. We see this happening today, especially with elements of history that people do not like. He also predicted the heavy use of what are basically headphones. I went for a walk this morning and noticed every one of the dozen or so people I saw had headphones in. As a big book-reader and someone who isn't paranoid about the government, I see Bradburry's vision as much more accurate than something like 1984. He was even wrong that the government would actively burn books by the will/request of the people. We don't have to worry about that now, people just stopped reading them. Hell, people buy digital books, so you can't even burn them anyway. But it doesn't matter, in the most recent Pew study (2014) 23% of people hadn't read a book in the past year. That's up from 8% in 1978, the first year they asked. The median number of books read a year by American adults is 4. We don't need to burn book, and the government doesn't need to ban them. We are doing this to ourselves. We have 100 of channel showing pointless shit on TV and endless ways to stalk people we don't even like on facebook and twitter, who needs books?Maybe his most accurate portrayal was related to this. One of the characters in the book, whom the police watch due to being 'peculiar', lives in the only house that doesn't glow blue at night. The family has their lights on and can be seen through the window sitting around talking, everyone else has their lights off and is watching TV, so that only a low, flickering blue color can be seen from the street. Where he is wrong is that no one thinks it odd now, but most people likely never think about it. I know I never did, but now if I walk around at night, I notice all the windows from the back of the houses and some of the bedrooms are dark and flickering blue. It becomes kind of eerie if you look or think about it too much.   Anyway, over all, the book is a bit over-dramatic at times, well not being dramatic enough in others, due to un-imagined technological change. The concepts are great and the portrayal of why life could be like in this dystopian future is frighteningly accurate at times. I as I said above, it is a classic in the genre, and a book to put on your reading list. More reviews - MondayMorningTheolgian.com","True","humor_entertainment"

The adventure module contained in the Starter Set is phenomenal! But my one Big Gripe with the Player's Handbook is the lack of a good index, and lack of useful cross-referencing. At the table, these books need to behave as efficient and effective *reference material*, and this makes indexing and cross referencing absolutely vital. This book is unwieldy at the table. In these days of searchable electronic documents, an unwieldy print document is unacceptable, and it's going to drive players to download illegal PDF copies just because they can be searched and hyperlinked.  Though, experience with 3e/3.5e makes me highly suspicious that there will be a 5.5e product which will fix issues like this... heck, I'd pay good money for a proprietary searchable/hyperlinked document from Wizards...","True","humor_entertainment"

"1165","B01IW9TM5O","4","Excellent read","2 people found this helpful","I’m honestly not a huge fan of biographies. But this was a fantastic read. Noah’s ability to reflect on how his life fit into the greater fabric of apartheid and the aftermath was exceptional. I particularly enjoyed his portrayal of his mother.The only thing that didn’t really work for me was the somewhat disjointed nature of the storyline.  I understand that this came from essays, which helps explain it a bit, but it didn’t seem like separate essays.  It seemed like a generally cohesive story that occasionally jumped around. This was particularly problematic toward the end, when he had finished high school, had a job, lost the job, then <bam> let’s talk about how my mother and stepfather met when I was 9. I get that he likely wanted to present that whole story about their relationship at once, for dramatic effect...? But I felt a little confused sometimes about WHEN certain events were occurring, which kind of took me “out” of the story.Just as an aside, I also wished that there was more about how he made it OUT of poverty. It felt like one minute he’s selling bootlegged CDs on a street corner, and the next he’s a comedian. I think part of what is remarkable about his story is that he came from such meager circumstances and managed to climb out and achieve great success. It’s inspiring, to be sure. But also confusing because it is kind of glossed over.All in all, though, it’s clear to see that this was a very personal work for Trevor Noah. It was a great book and I have a lot of respect for both his writing and his willingness to open up about his history. I definitely recommend this book.","True","humor_entertainment"

"8436","141501596","5","Colorful, Educational and Entertaining Book","","If you want an entertaining book to teach young children their colors, this one is a delight.  I loved reading this book to my young students (18 months through kindergarten) and they paid rapt attention.  They enjoy the colorful and original art.  And they like the sing-song rhyme of the text.While it says the book is for children two to five years of age, I think you can read it as soon as a child is ready for books like 6 months or possibly younger. Young children can begin to learn colors, numbers and letter sounds from birth.  I used to recite the letter sounds with accompanying letter pictures (a for apple) to my sons, and by age age two they knew all of their letter sounds, by three they were reading words and by four they were reading books.  Also did counting and color activities and books with them. They knew the colors by the age of two as I read books like this one to them and played color games with them.Early learning, when done with a non-pressured and joyous, happy approach is wonderful for young children as their minds are so absorbent.  They want to learn, are wired to learn and don't distinguish between learning and play. If they can learn to speak a foreign language in six months at the age of four when it takes an adult years, it is clear their minds are like a sponge at these young ages.  Books that teach while entertain, like this one, are wonderful.  This book is a classic book for young children.","True","children"

Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed with this book.  I always finish what I start, so I did muddle through and found the last quarter of the book to be better than the previous.  The minute details of things that had no baring on the story line was the most frustrating and seemed to drag out the plot.  I understand descriptive writing, but do we really care what colors are being used in every flower arrangement made?  Lots of characters with back stories that really never tied together and had nothing to do with the plot, i.e. The Witness' son getting his girlfriend pregnant (why was that even in there?).  Guess I'm just not a fan of this writing style and sorry to say, this was definitely not my cup of tea..","True","mystery"
"16774","1984806734","4","4 Stars - Really good","9 people found this helpful","I just wasn't sure about this one when I requested it. The cover is that stinking animated trend that I really dislike. I don't always read adult books due to potential content, but I've learned that just because a book is labeled adult doesn't mean it has to include graphic content. I'm not familiar with this author (although I am interested in looking into her other books). But the description had a few things going for it that pulled me in. I loved that both main characters are authors, and I also liked their bet/challenge about stepping out of their normal genres to write something different.January is disillusioned. Her father recently passed away, and on the day of his funeral she found out that he'd had an affair while her mother was fighting cancer. And her long-term boyfriend couldn't handle her journey through grief and betrayal. Struggling with writing anything romance-driven, she's in a financial bind as well. So January moves temporarily into her father's lake house to empty it and sell it...while also writing a book.January quickly realizes that her next-door neighbor is Gus Everett who she went to college with. Back then, Gus repeatedly criticized her writing because of her perpetual happy endings. He also chose to only critique her during class which caused a lot of resentment. Yet there's always another side to the story.I loved the insight we're given into the writing and even briefly into the publishing process. This isn't too detailed. It didn't take over the story, but I think Emily Henry included just the right amount of both the story January was writing and the process itself.Gus was endearing. He's awkward. He sees the world in a darker way than January does. Yet he's drawn to her light. There was not much that I didn't like about Gus.I don't always address this because I feel like I would be repeating myself in 90% of my reviews, but there were certainly many moral decisions in this book that I don't personally support. My thoughts on many of these things the majority of our country would consider outdated, but that doesn't change the fact that I hold to a different moral standard than the average American (or so it seems these days).Favorite quotes:-It wasn’t that I couldn’t get enough of him. Or that he was the best man I’d ever known. (I’d thought that was my dad, but now it was the dad from my favorite 2000s teen drama, Veronica Mars.) Or that he was my favorite person. (That was Shadi.) Or because he made me laugh so hard I wept. (He laughed easily, but rarely joked.) Or that when something bad happened, he was the first person I wanted to call. (He wasn’t.) It was that we met at the same age my parents had, that the snowball fight and impromptu road trip had felt like fate, that my mother adored him. He fit so perfectly into the love story I’d imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life.-Anger with all the broken parents, heartache that they too must’ve felt like kids—helpless, unsure how to make the right decisions, terrified of making the wrong ones.-“You don’t believe in any kind of internal moral compass.” The way he said it made it seem as if he himself did believe in such a thing, which would’ve surprised me a few weeks ago, but now made perfect sense. “Maybe you start out with that,” she said, “But if you do, it gets shaped as you age. How are you supposed to believe right’s right and wrong’s wrong if everyone around you says the opposite? You’re supposed to think you’re smarter than all of them?”-“You don’t know the difference between pity and sympathy,” I said. “I’m not pitying you. It makes me sad to think of you being treated like that. It makes me mad to think you didn’t have the things all kids deserve. And yeah, it makes me mad and sad that a lot of people go through the things you went through, but it’s even more upsetting because it’s you. And I know you and I like you and I want you to have a good life. That’s not pity. That’s caring about someone.”-You make beautiful things, because you love the world, and maybe the world doesn’t always look how it does in your books, but … I think putting them out there, that changes the world a little bit. And the world can’t afford to lose that.”These quotes remind me of a few things I want to mention. The second quote is a reminder that I now read from a parental figure's point of view just as much as the main character. I can't turn it off. The third reminds me that I can't base what I believe to be right or wrong upon myself or anyone else or even a large collection of others. God's Word will always be my moral compass. I have and will fall short. But I at least have a guide that does not waver. The fourth is a pet peeve of mine. Characters in books often disdain what they perceive as pity, but sympathy is usually what's being extended to them by people who care. And those people don't have to be in their close inner circle to care. For the last quote, I fancy seeing myself writing a book one day. And if I ever do, I hope that my characters or my world might not be realistic so much as hopeful or portrayals of what can be.Beach Read was much better than I expected it to be. I really enjoyed the process of the relationship between Gus and January. I appreciated her journey through grief and beginning to heal. I also liked the information surrounding writing, the process, and the publishing side we get to see. I do have to say that I didn't love the information dump in the form of letters January's father wrote to her before he died. Beach Read gets 4 Stars. Have you read Beach Read? What did you think?

"338","451524934","5","The Futility of Resistance","2 people found this helpful","1984 was written in 1949 during the Cold War and the great fear of the communist invasion. It was rumored that communist spies were living amongst our society and threatened our very way of life. 1984 displays a powerful warning of what fear can lead to. This novel proves to maintain its relevancy even in today’s society, as we fear constant government surveillance under the guise of fighting the war on terror. The novel is not for children as it depicts scenes of torture. George Orwell’s 1984 has become the epitome of a dystopian society.George Orwell’s classic 1984 centers on the totalitarian control of Oceania. Citizens of Oceania live under constant surveillance from the “telescreens” and microphones placed everywhere from their house to place of work. Any facial expression that might show a feeling of distaste towards the “Party” in control will result in arrest, interrogation, and ultimately execution by the “Thought Police.” Even the children are taught espionage and to betray their parents at any sign of dissent from the “Party.” Individuality has been completely eradicated because any perceived eccentricity means certain death.The “Party” has complete control over the history that is presented to its citizens. They use this control to create the image of an infallible presence. Any contradiction to their word will be rewritten to portray the party in the correct manner. Because of the complete control that the “Party” has over its citizens, anything they say instantly becomes fact. The “Party” tells people that 2+2=5 and they unquestionably accept it as the truth. The “Party” seeks complete control over its citizen’s thoughts and even goes so far as to attempt to eradicate the orgasmOceania is constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia and changes throughout the novel. When the enemy changes, the history books are rewritten so that Oceania is always at war with the one enemy. This constant state of war is used to keep the citizens of Oceania in fear of the outside world. Public executions of captured enemy combatants are to dehumanize the enemy and show that only “Party” members are human.The protagonist, Winston Smith, lives with distaste of the “Party”. After engaging in an unauthorized affair with Julia, the two of them seek out the rumored resistance to the “Party”. This resistance proves to be futile as they are both arrested by the “Thought Police” very quickly. After months of torture, Winston completely conforms and accepts that 2+2=5 and that he loves Big Brother.","True","humor_entertainment"

I borrowed it from the library when this is one that 100% deserves to be purchased.It was utterly wonderful. I adored this book! I love the MCs imperfections. I loved that they knew each other but not really years before. I loved that he was smitten with her back in the day! (I honestly skipped ahead and found this out, but I didn’t even care because it made him so much more endearing.) It's 1st Person, FMC's POV, slow burn, dare I say, grump/grump trope? The romance was so sweet. It was subtle in the perfect places--the kind that is begging to be reread so you can soak everything up. This is a book that lived up to the damn hype, and I have almost no complaints.This book is absolutely Women's Fiction though. This is not a romance. This has a heavy romance, no lie, but this is Women's Fiction with Romance. The author mentions in the acknowledgments that she tells other writers that this book is about writer's block. Not the romance. It's also very wordy. Like, overwritten, over described, heavy inner monologue which really speaks to women's fiction more than romance as a genre. The plot of them switching genres begins on page 80 of 360ish, so it's a very slow moving plot. But it is incredibly developed. The A plot mixes seamlessly with the B and C plots. You can't have one without the other and I really appreciated that. The plots are also really heavy, again, more women's lit than romance.The back story is really told, not shown, but it is told in a more compelling way than straight true info dumping, and it's told it a beautiful manner. I felt like some of the chapter endings were random. Like, oh crap, gotta cap this chapter now and start the new one. It wasn't distracting too much; it just felt weird. Weirder though, was the choice to have sex--multiple times--outside of a burned down cult site. Like, MMC brought condoms for that outting when he hadn't had them for their other sexytime. So. It was clearly a choice. Unless they stopped using condoms, but given the mention of them . . . it just wasn't the sexiest choice in the world.I loved this book. I'm really looking forward to reading more from Ms. Henry. And I can't wait to buy the book myself and reread it.This one lives up to the hype.","True","romance"

I'm extremely grateful that I never had to read this for school, because I don't think I would have enjoyed it nearly as much if I had to underline passages, take notes, and try to remember who said what and what it meant.Even as an adult reading this book for pleasure, I felt like I should be underlining things, just because there were so many sentences that seemed loaded with meaning that should be ruminated on. It got me thinking, about human interaction, about the evolution of technology, about censorship, about the role ignorance plays in happiness, about the role knowledge plays in power.It was a quick read, but it lingers in your mind.","True","humor_entertainment"

"1762","786965606","4","The book is nice. Illustrations are pretty although not necessary","","What is there to say.  It's a D&D book.  Ignoring anything about the new system introduced by Wizards of the Coast.  The book is nice.  Illustrations are pretty although not necessary.  It reads like you could actually play basic adventures with just this book as there are some basic beasts (monsters) given in the book.  It is broken up into 3 sections.  The first one and largest one being character creation, which has always been the meat of Player's Handbooks.  The second one pertains to adventuring rules, which I was surprised to find in this book and not have to wait for the DM Guide to get.  The last section is magic which is just your standard how to use and then a compiled list of spells.  The big problem about the book is the cross-referencing.  The pages all have the page number and section number on the bottom, but NOT the chapter numbers.  And whenever you come across a rule in the text that is addressed somewhere else in the book, the book tells you to ""see CHAPTER XX.""  In this case you have no quick way to find said rule.  First you have to find the chapter by actually going through the book and then you have to page through the chapter and scan every page until you find the reference.  This problem would have been highly reduced and easily fixed by listing the chapter number on the bottom of pages (No one cares about the section number), or with a little bit of extra work by referencing the exact page the rule is on (i.e. ""see page XX"").  The index is also not as well done or as complete as you might like.","True","humor_entertainment"
"15826","1984806734","4","Fun, Flirty Summer Escapism","","January Andrews is a bestselling romance novelist who stops believing in happy endings after the death of her father leads to the discovery that he had a secret house and lover. Then her longtime partner leaves her for being too sad.Unsurprisingly, this makes it hard for her to do her job- write books where everyone lives happily ever after.January is running out of options- and money- so she moves to the love nest her father left to her in the small lake town of North Bear, Michigan to get it ready to sell and to write her next book.She doesn’t have high expectations of North Bear, but what she didn’t expect was for her next-door neighbor to be Agustus Everett- her college nemesis who has his own successful career writing literary fiction.It’s soon apparent that in a town this small there isn’t much chance of not running into the other woman who she’s always trying to avoid, let alone Agustus.He’s struggling with writer’s block too, so to motivate themselves into writing they make a bet. Each writer agrees to write a book in the other’s genre.But, since Gus doesn’t have much experience with happily ever afters and January needs research for her work, they agree on regular outings to educate each other on the necessary elements of each genre.The thing is, these “research outings” start to look a lot like dates.And January and Augustus find it increasingly harder to pretend that they don’t enjoy each other’s company.Enemies to lovers is one of my favorite romance tropes, and Beach Read is a fun example of just how entertaining it is when done well.I would say that Augustus and January’s coming together was less due to character development and more to them dropping the pretenses and being vulnerable to each other. While I love to see some transformation in the main characters, the book still had them come together in a satisfying way.This book had lots of gems for bibliophiles, some literary jokes had me nearly spitting out the margarita I was sipping while reading this by the pool. There were a number of cheesy moments, but Henry embraces them and they work to make this a fun romantic comedy.What the book was not?Sappy. With a character that’s a self-professed romantic at heart, albeit a temporarily disillusioned one, it could have easily gone the other direction. I’m glad Henry keeps it in check and makes things believable between the two characters.A few minor characters really stood out as well.The pacing of this book worked well. The plot moved along at a pace to keep you reading and engaged, while still giving the feel of long summer days.My main criticisms of the book are that I’d have liked to see more character growth and exploration of some of the deeper themes the book discusses. A bit more balance between the romance and literary fiction that the characters write, if you will. But for escapism, this book is hard to beat.","False","romance"

I can't stop recommending it to people, even my guy friends.After reading the author's note I'm not sure how anyone can consider this anything but a masterpiece. ""When friends ask me what Beach Read is about, I tell them it's about a disillusioned romance author and a literary fiction writer who make a deal to swap genres for the summer. When other writers ask me what Beach Read is about, I tell them it's about writer's block."" Personally, I think I would describe this as a complicated adult contemporary romance about two authors finding solace in each other at a time where they are both dealing with a lot of emotional baggage.I understand why some reviews say this wasn't the type of romance they were expecting. The cover and title are a bit misleading. This is definitely not a light and fun summer read. There's a big focus on writing and craft, a book about writing a book you could say, but it also examines grief and mourning. It hones in on how differently people see the world and why some of us are more pessimistic/optimistic than others. Who are we - bright lights or black holes? How do we cope with knowing that happiness is not guaranteed?The developing relationship was a slow burn. I lived for every knee bump, nose nuzzle, breathy ear whisper, and pretend nonchalant touching of skin and limbs. The sex scenes were intense but poetic, exactly how I like them.Emily Henry's writing was easy to devour but also lyrical. Her primary and secondary characters were all so well written, flawed but evolving. The witty banter was top-notch. There were many things I loved - the perfectly crafted references to books and movies, the notes they held up for each other from one window to the other, the hesitancy to ask questions, intimately getting to know someone you think you already have all figured out then realizing how wrong you were, allowing them to challenge and change your perspective. I laughed. I cried. I was at the edge of my seat. I felt it all on such a deep, human level.I finished this yesterday and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

In perfect new condition and in a timely manner. There is nothing wrong with it, no damage or missing pages. MANY people that wrote reviews on this book were reviewing the book itself and not the quality of their order, which I what I THINK these reviews are supposed to be for. When people want to see reviews before ordering a book off of Amazon I THINK they want to know if it comes as advertised and damage free, not people’s opinion on the story in the book. Maybe I’m wrong, but that’s what I look for personally. Many people HATE this book because they find everything they don’t agree with “offensive”. So opinions about a story or the contents of a book are not GENERALLY what people want to know when reading an Amazon review IMHO, especially a HUGE review on WHY they hate the book.

Being that this is a book that is meant to be handled frequently I am not surprised that none of the pages are damaged or discolored, everything is right where it is, but i wanted to open a book with nice clean, flat, fresh unseen pages. Not a handful of them with a unsettling ripple effect to them. Therefore it loses a star.","True","humor_entertainment"

"1854","786965606","5","Solid book with solid choices","","The 5th edition Player's Handbook is an awesome update on previous editions with solid art and information. Subclassing is a great way of putting tons of variation into character creation. Even though there are only technically 12 classes, with each class having at least two subclasses, traditions, circles, orders, domains, colleges, schools, etc. there's closer to 40 options for builds just in the class selection. Top that off with most classes having some form of access to magic and the ability to multiclass easily (no penalties to multiclassing like in 3.x and multiclassing isn't as useless as in 4e), and the classes are entirely solid in this PHB.Races have a similar amount of selection as classes do, with many races having some sort of subrace(s), the exceptions being humans, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings. Dragonborn have subraces in the form of choosing the color of scales and the breath weapon associated with that, but their subrace variant isn't exactly variant in itself.Equipment, feats, etc. is all pretty well detailed. The trinkets table is interesting as well.The book itself is well made. The art is good and abundant with lots of detail put into it. The only negative I have with regards to the book is that the pages smear easily if I have anything on my fingers that is somewhat oily, greasy, wet, etc. So I would advise against eating chips and flipping through it.","True","humor_entertainment"

"1792","786965606","5","Streamlined","7 people found this helpful","A short background: I'm not really a tabletop RPG gamer.  Sure, I have a buddy that runs some games (that's why I picked this up), have dabbled in the past with other friends, and I have played BG2, Icewind Dale, and NW and NW2 into the ground, so I know my D&D.  As a dad with a full-time job, I just don't have the time or energy to spend 3-5 hours every week after work dungeon crawling.With that background in place, I find this book to be an absolute breath of fresh air.  This is a great ruleset for someone without the time or ability to really delve into a character, or for a group to quickly set up a crawl on a cold winter weekend.  The rules have been streamlined from my days with 3.5e and Pathfinder (they are a touch simpler, much more efficient, and involve very few negative numbers).  More importantly, the rules put quite a bit more emphasis on roleplaying and acting a part.  That is not to say the depth is gone.  Not even close.  It is absolutely still there for the GM and others if you want it (just look at some of the other reviews and Wizards own running blog to demonstrate that), particularly if you look at the other books and really get into the feats and adventuring sections of the PH.Best example of how this ruleset is different than previous iterations: I can look at my wife and say ""sure love, you can play an elvish barbarian if you want,"" knowing that it will actually be fun for her.  She might still stink compared to a min/max half-orc barbarian, but the rules are much more forgiving of such oddball characters.  They seem to WANT you to try goofy things like that and just play it out!On top of all that, the book has nice art, is well designed, and a good read (if you enjoy rule books).  Overall, very happy with the purchase, even if it only comes off the shelf every few months.","True","humor_entertainment"

Also, I really enjoyed his stories about his kids and his tributes to his mother. Loved it!But I want to mention something that, for me, was a big missing piece, which was a description of the beginning of putting the Foo Fighters band together. Dave leaps from the intermission between the end of Nirvana to suddenly the release of FFs’ second album and world tour. How did FF come together? He mentions the band members at the end, almost as a tribute (which moved my review from a 4- to a 5-star), but I really wanted more insight into the origins of the Foo Fighters. I guess that’s my own personal obsession, and shouldn’t  distract from the joy of reading this wonderful memoir. Congrats, Dave. It’s a great read.

"126","451524934","5","A look at our future, from our past","One person found this helpful","When Orwell originally wrote 1984, it was to be called 1948. This was  because he'd figured that by 1948 the world would be split into  ""superstates"", and all a form of some totalitarianism or other.  And a terrifyingly new kind of totalitarianism. One that utilizes  technology to invade the privacy of every one of it's citizens. Orwell gave  us the term ""big brother is watching"". And this is done by  cameras that are placed everywhere. Knowing it to be impossible for someone  to watch you 24 hours a day is small comfort when you never know when  you're being watched.  It bothers me that Orwell is not  considered to be one of the great authors of the 20th century, as he was so  adept at breaking down complex societies, and goverments into contexts that  most everyone can understand. Both in 1984, and Animal Farm.  1984 is the story about an average man who finds more and more that the  life he's leading, and the government he works for is wrong. Horribly  wrong. The society he lives in is sick. In time he discovers, through a  forbidden book, that the decades long war they've been fighting against the  other superstates is actually a fabrication based on the concept that war  can sustain an entire economy, because everything that a society produces  is destroyed. And that stoking the fears and hatreds towards the other  superstates can create a nucleus that a society can form it's self around.  We are versed on double-think, and  double-speak; where one can spout, and believe government rhetoric, all the  while knowing the truth right in front of their face. The book is endlessly  fascinating, well written, and deeply provocative. It is, after all, a  classic.","True","humor_entertainment"

I was on the fence about reading The Proposal until I saw that it was Carlos’ love story, at which point my interest was up 1000%. Although I had to speed read this book to make sure I finished it before my ebook was returned to the library, I thoroughly enjoyed it; I probably would’ve read it nearly as fast without the time crunch.I loved Nikole and Carlos right away, and had so much fun reading their story. I loved their banter and inside jokes and the generally sweet nature of their relationship. (Now the thought of sour cream makes me giggle. If you know, you know.) I also really liked Nik’s friends, Dana and Courtney, and how they roasted one another so frequently but were still, without fail, each other’s biggest cheerleaders. (And reading about Courtney’s cupcake shop has me craving cupcakes. I don’t have cupcakes. Crap.)In both books I’ve read by Guillory at this point in time, I’ve noticed some conversations with rather cheesy dialogue, though I can overlook that since her books are so much fun to read. What I can’t overlook so easily is the surprising amount of similarities between her protagonists and love interests. Each side character is unique, but the same can’t be said about the stars of the show. Alexa, Drew, and now Nikole and Carlos are all very driven people, hard-working but still very social, that for some reason or another aren’t looking for a serious, long-term relationship. Both The Wedding Date and The Proposal go about like this: two attractive people meet, want sex, have sex, like it enough to continue having sex, catch feels, realize they caught feels, bail on said feels, mope about until their friends encourage them to kiss and make up, then actually kiss and make up, the end.I know romance novels are usually formulaic to some extent and I don’t mind that. Over the last several months, I’ve grown to love them despite the fairly obvious patterns, and find them very comforting to read. However, something about this specific situation, with these specific books, just feels janky to me, and I wanted to mention it.That being said, it didn’t stop me from loving this book or adding the rest of the books in the series to my TBR, and it certainly won’t stop me from recommending this book to others.

The pages are basic and not too distracting when she “works”. I know these print outs might be easy to diy online, but this workbook is totally worth it. First, the price is amazing! Very reasonable. If I made something like this myself, I probably would be paying more in printing and time putting it together then the book itself. Secondly, my daughter enjoys her “special” book. Since it came in the mail it made the book a bit more special to her, so she’s more motivated to do it. She asks for her book to “work” every morning. Lastly, the quality is great. The pages are nice to turn and it’s nicely colored. There’s also opportunity to use the page multiple times. Sometimes I encourage my daughter to use a lighter color so she can retrace with a darker color.This is great to have on hand especially for us during covid and fires nearby; we have a lot of indoor time.

Although how a book that involves researching a murder-suicide cult can possibly be this cute I really don’t know. But it is.I’ve read a lot of romance books lately, from steamy to rom-com, to cry-your-eyes-out-heartbreaking and I was starting to think there were no really new stories in the world. Until Beach Read. It was refreshingly different.January and Gus are both novelists who end up living next door to each other (for reasons I won’t reveal in order to avoid spoilers). They enter into a bet that the other person couldn’t swap genres for their next book. They help each other with different research methods and activities, which naturally end up like bizarre sorts of dates as they both write their next novels.The characters in Beach Read are wonderful, well actually they’re pretty flawed, but they’re wonderfully developed. And while it’s no surprise that they become involved it was beautiful to watch them uncover things about each other and help the other grow and move through their insecurities and past trauma.Plus the book is packed with hilarious details about the writing process. Like when you’re watching a movie and the lead suddenly turns to the camera and speaks to you directly, letting you in on a little secret. They even talk about their favorite reviews, like the guy that left one star on Amazon saying “Did not order Book” or the ones who explain what the author was ‘really’ trying to do. As a reviewer, that had me in stitches.Through their genre-swap Gus and January are researching a cult called New Eden though, and there are a few dark topics and moments touched on, so be aware of that going into it.I love that the author wrote this book, about writer’s block, because she actually had writer’s block. She was itching to write, but no sparks of an idea or story were coming to her, so she started researching and thinking about writer’s block itself…and now here we are!This gets all the stars from me, and the audiobook is wonderful too if you’d like to be read to.

I was depressed already at that age. I think this would have pushed me off the cliff. I understand there is more to this book in literary terms, the elements of writing, the historical reference to communism and socialism etc., but since I no longer read books for a lit class in my old age, I just want something I enjoy enough to immerse myself in. And it doesn't need at all to be flowery, happy ending, saccharine stuff. Quite the contrary.  I honestly dreaded returning to it each day and forced myself to finish it. Animal Farm was far better, with the same elements of writing and reference to political history and fears of the time. And more clever too. But I'm told that Orwell was I'll when he wrote this, which explains the disjointed feel overall. Now I understand references to ""room 101"" and ""teleprompter"" etc. But I was fine not actually knowing what they meant. This book really didn't add anything to my life.

"2219","1451673310","5","Bradbury's Fire Forever Lights the Way","One person found this helpful","For me, Fahrenheit 451 more than deserves its place among the top five on my 'Absolute Best Books Ever' list. How anyone who has actually carefully digested it could possibly give it less than five out of five stars is quite beyond me. But to each his own, I do suppose. And really good books don't always have to satisfy absolutely everyone, to have the lasting effect that this particular one has most certainly had.What more to say? Well, for starters, judging by Fahrenheit 451 alone, Ray Bradbury was nothing short of a literary genius, and it's a truly invaluable thing that he gifted future generations with a yarn so exquisitely told. Full of thought provoking contradictions, like the bizarre dystopian future it depicts, the author's narrative alternates between being complicated and deceptively simplistic in its approach, yet is somehow still equal parts subtle and heavy handed in just the right measure when necessary.For example, the premise itself, that one dark day, in a potentially dark future, firemen will burn books, homes and even people, instead of preserving and protecting them, might seem absurd if Bradbury didn't handle the material with such seemingly effortless brilliance. So much so, that the reader's natural inclination towards disbelief is subordinated to such a profound degree, that before you know it, you're seeing shades of genuine fascism in the Firemen, and in all of the chief antagonist's perverted banter, that turns the concepts of equality and justice upside down and backwards, and may actually leave one wondering how much of what Captain Beatty says is really something to think ever so deeply about.And the implications of the totalitarian future Bradbury presents really is troubling.  Even scary. But that frightful roller coaster of inverted thought patterns and potential future realities is what makes Fahrenheit 451 work so astoundingly well. But is that really the precise temperature at which paper ignites and bursts into flame? How incredibly irrelevant! The real point is that few other works of imaginative fiction have done such a superb job of giving readers so very much to think about while reading so precious few pages.Sure, the book isn't especially long, but does it really have to be? It's true. In pretty short order Bradbury introduces his suddenly shell shocked to true life protagonist, and the ill fated young muse who breathes new life in him. It all seems so mundane at first, but then the author takes us into Montag's home, all through his workplace, and then out and about, into a frighteningly macabre, yet antiseptically stale and deathly whited sepulcher of an urban futurescape, where the meaning of literacy itself is under full scale attack. And once we've seen all that, what more is there really to know, but how is it all going to end?And since Bradbury's cautionary tale is all about burning anything incongruous or even potentially ""antisocial"" in society to indistinct, untraceable ash, all that is left after we've seen how bleak and twisted what has become of the American founding fathers' original quest for equality and the pursuit of happiness, is to take the plunge into the author's masterful ending, that, despite its apocalyptic overtones, actually ends up becoming a whole new beginning for mankind. And for goodness sake, people, how could anyone ask for anything more from one of the greatest achievements of one of the finest science fiction authors ever?","True","humor_entertainment"

"1917","786965606","5","Exceptional value - great book","","I am an old school D&D gamer/Dungeon Master who cut his teeth on the 'Red' basic set and then moved into ""Advanced Dungeons and Dragons"" (1st ed.), all the while trying other stuff like Star Frontiers and I.C.E. By the time 2nd edition came out, I had moved on. Just recently, I decided to get back into it and started up a 1st edition campaign. As the new 5th edition material came out, I bought them initially 'out of curiosity' and have now started a 5th edition campaign. I may move exclusively into 5th edition because of the common sense ideas, ease of play, and stunning packaging. Having the basic set of rule for 5th edition available on line for free makes it easy for new players to prepare before committing to buying anything.I love this new 'Players Handbook'. The gaming system itself is pretty streamlined and set up more for 'role-playing' than it is for super accuracy in actions. A new player could pick this book up (or use the online rules) to create a character very quickly and easily. There are quick set-ups for characters (with everything laid out - just plug in your numbers) and quick set-ups for equipment (like explorer packs). I like how some of the rules differ from 1st edition to 5th edition, e.g., how armor class is the number needed to hit, how 1st level characters start with maximum hit points, and how spell points make a low level magic-user much more useful. There are all the old races and classes plus a few new ones too.Old gamers looking to get back in should start here with 5th edition. New gamers will find this an easy way to start.","True","humor_entertainment"

It was also a novel about growing up -not so much coming of age, but about growing and changing as an adult when life throws specific challenges your way. It lets us know it is normal to be optimistic and want to hope for happy endings, but your views can also change in an instant when the stark realities of life hit. The story is a slow journey of healing through complicated grief, that the protagonist isn’t even aware of until it is already happening, followed by a choice to allow this healing to happen. January shows readers that you don’t have to put on a brave face all the time, and often that is more harmful in the long run- sometimes like breaks you, and you’re allowed to fall apart. She demonstrates that you’re allowed to have both good and bad days- it’s not one or the other.  Overall it was heartwarming- showing the many different forms of love one can have in their life.","False","romance"

"15385","1984806734","4","A predictable ending does not spoil the joy of the journey","","As the Disney folks reminded us in Beauty & the Beast, it's a ""tale as old as time."" But author Emily Henry has put her unique stamp on a classic tale, and made it more than just a romantic romp. Beach Read may have a fluffy title, but there is real substance to Henry's story of two writers who must overcome heartbreak, and set aside their preconceived ideas and assumptions about each other, and life, to forge a relationship.January has come to North Bear Shores, Michigan for the summer. Her previous books -- romantic comedies -- have sold well, but the royalties have stopped flowing in and she's down to just a few dollars in her bank account. Her next book is due at the end of the summer, but she's suffering from a severe case of writer's block that she needs to break through in order to meet her deadline. She's endured a lot in the past year. Her beloved father's sudden, unexpected death was followed by shocking revelations about his life. January learned everything she knew about love and life from her parents. An only child, her parents doted on and supported her. But more importantly, they modeled a loving, committed, demonstrative relationship that she held up as an ideal. Once, when she was a child, they briefly separated, but soon reconciled. To January, it seemed that her family always emerged from troubled times stronger, with more love and laughter than before the dark days. Her father stood by her mother through two successful cancer battles. So January was flabbergasted to learn that her father had an extramarital relationship that spanned years and took place on weekends at his secret lake house. She found out about the affair at his funeral when a strange woman introduced herself as an ""old friend"" of January's father, and presented January with an envelope and a key. January immediately knew why the woman was there, and her suspicions were confirmed when her mother hissed, ""Sonya,"" revealing that her mother had known about her father's relationship. But her mother refuses to discuss the matter. Sonya tells January that her father wanted her to have the beautiful house on Lake Michigan. Now she needs to dispose of her father's personal property, sell the house, and ""write a romance despite having recently lost close to all faith in love and humanity.""January quickly discovers that her next-door neighbor is none other than her college rival, Gus. In the ensuing years, Gus has used his full name -- Augustus Everett -- because he has become a published author of a serious book that remained on the bestseller list for five weeks. But in college, he was known as Sexy, Evil Gus, and January was ""minorly besotted with him and his prose."" January felt Gus didn't take her seriously after she presented him a short story to be critiqued and he told her, ""Let me guess: Everyone lives happily ever after. Again."" At that point, January was not yet a romance writer, but she was writing ""romantically, about a good world, where things happened for a reason, where love and human connection were all that really mattered."" During college the two of them competed for recognition and writing prizes, but barely spoke until one fateful night at a fraternity party . . .January and Gus are reunited in his aunt's local bookstore and their journey to happily-ever-after begins. Gus proposes a bet. He will spend the summer writing a romance, and January will write the kind of ""bleak literary fiction"" that Gus has previously published. They will take each other on field trips designed to illuminate the important components of the type of fiction each will be writing. Gus takes January to the burned-out remains of a cult tucked deep into the forest and she accompanies him when he spends hours interviewing a survivor who was raised there. January takes Gus line dancing, to a drive-in movie, and on other romantic adventures. They agree that ""whoever sells their book first -- with a pen name, if you prefer -- wins."" The loser will have to promote the winner's book by writing an endorsement for the cover, recommending it during interviews, and choosing it when judging for book clubs. Gus throws in another stipulation: ""Promise not to fall in love with me.""The secret to Beach Read's charm is the crisp, snappy, and frequently hilarious conversations between January and Gus as the weeks pass. There is also much they don't say as each struggles to regain confidence in their writing . . . and themselves.Henry credibly examines both January's grief and rage. January feels she can't write another love story because the stories she crafts mean so much to her, and she can't deliver a book to her readers that she doesn't believe in. After all, her whole perspective on life and relationships has been disrupted, rocked to its very foundation by her father's deceit. She was so close to her parents, but also felt pressure not to add to her parents' worries as her mother fought for her life. For years, January was so afraid that her mother would die, she did everything she could to make her parents proud, spending time with them, and publishing her first book at the age of twenty-five. She even fell in love with Jacques, a handsome doctor. Now her father is suddenly gone and she can never ask him all the questions that keep her up at night, never confront him with her frustration about all the years she spent carefully constructing a life free from complications. She has broken off her long-term relationship with Jacques, realizing in the weeks following her father's death when she was depressed and questioning everything she had always assumed to be true, that he could not provide the emotional support she needed. Now she's alone, unable to talk to her mother about her feelings, broke and desperate to fulfill her commitment to her publisher, and living in a house where her father spent time with the woman who was not January's mother.Although January began writing romance novels because she ""wanted to dwell in my happiest moments, in the safe place my parents' love had always been,"" Gus, in contrast, found inspiration in his troubled childhood, ""to try to understand something horrible that had happened to him."" And his writing block has been occasioned by more recent heartbreak that he gradually reveals to January.That the ""will they or won't they"" story takes a predictable path does not detract from the enjoyment of going on the journey with January and Gus. Henry populates the story with an eclectic cast of supporting characters, including Gus's aunt Pete and her wife, Maggie, who are genuine and endearing. January's first-person narrative is emotionally raw -- January lays bare the innermost thoughts, doubts, and feelings that make her empathetic, likable, and authentic. She achieves just the right tone. The characters of January and Gus are fully developed and nuanced, especially as they discuss the art of writing, and their dissimilar approaches to the craft, but ultimately learn how much they have in common. They challenge each other as writers and people, and their egalitarian relationship is a welcome departure from many romantic comedies that depict a weak woman chasing a  strong man. As the relationship between January and Gus blossoms, there is no power disparity.Beach Read is a delightfully fresh retelling of a tried-and-true story. Two enemies challenge and compete with each other and, in the process, learn things about each other that causes them to see each other in a new, appreciative way. That leads to romance and a happy ending. Beach Read lives up to its title in the sense that it is an ideal story in which to get lost on a hot summer day on a beach, by a lake or pool, or in a hammock in one's own back yard.Thanks to NetGalley for an Advance Reader's Copy of the book.","False","romance"

"117","451524934","4","Be prepared","","The premise of the book is to explore human nature and how as a group they can be manipulated and ruled. The book moves through some obvious manipulations to the grander more subtle perversions of the human mind that would let someone be persuaded to not just be controlled but to think in a suggested way. Of course it is well written but it is not always a clear and concise read. When discussing ideological matters it seams to nite quite clearly explain the way in which the government effects change in people and meanders around the points of why and for whom these changes are affected. The largest inconsistency of which is the eagerness of the general population to forget the past and simply believe the new past the government has devised. As this is part of the point of this book I concede to the point that the reader should not necessarily relate to this group thought process but it could have been better addressed as a construction of the world view. Overall it is an interesting topic and a departure from the norm. It is a discussion of power and religion and love and pain and deceit.","True","humor_entertainment"

I can see why LOVE AND OTHER WORDS connected with so many readers, but I didn't entirely feel the same level of adoration to the story as a whole.Through past/present storytelling, Christina Lauren takes the reader on a journey back to Elliot and Masie's past from when they first met through when they fell in love and later fell apart. Eleven years after their breakup, the two meet again and Elliot is just as in love with her as he was as a teenager. But one problem—Masie is engaged.Christina Lauren almost always writes delicious red-hot chemistry with great banter and dreamy heroes. Those things are present in Love and Other Words. Even though Elliot's character fell into the ""too perfect to feel real"" category, I still swooned hard over his intelligence, nerdiness, and sweetness. Lauren built up their love story as children so well, showing the reader how these two bookworm nerds fell hard for each other over the course of several years. I loved reading their past love story. In a way, we got a what I like to call a ""double love story"" because we got to see them fall in love twice. This book made me feel addicted to it because I kept needing to know what happens next. I love it when that happens!This is Christina Lauren's first foray into women's fiction, so I was curious to see how their writing talents transferred into this new genre for them. My biggest question was how they were going to craft the conflict. In the past, the conflict in some of their stories hasn't been the strongest, which causes the whole story to deflate when it should be exploding.In an attempt to explain away some of the plot contrivances, Lauren asks the reader to believe a lot. Somehow, Elliot didn't know that Masie's dad had passed away. After being best friends for years and deeply in love, Elliot didn't aggressively attempt to reach out to Masie. On the flip side, Masie didn't want to talk over what she saw with Elliot? I don't buy it. If she was that in love to drive hours to see him that night, that same girl would have been pounding at his door and shoving at his chest screaming, ""WHAT THE HELL?!"" Neither Elliot nor Masie ever met their mutual friends in nearly six years of friendship, until the night they broke up. Masie was engaged when she sees Elliot again. But it's a little too convenient that her fiancé is not really that in to her and was totally fine with her ending it.Both characters felt like the same character type we've seen in other Christina Lauren type books. We have the really nerdy sensitive guy and the female professional whose profession didn't really play a part in her character. Though, I did like see Lauren write a story with everyday people, instead of high-powered executives we've seen in the past. With this being billed as women's fiction, I was expecting to see more of an interplay between Masie's profession and her life as well as a more developed emotional arc for Masie's character. Neither of those things really occurred here. To me, this felt like more of a contemporary romance and less like a women's fiction novel. Also, Elliot's life in the present isn't really explored in any detail either. I couldn't even tell you what he does or what he likes (aside from Masie and literature).I really didn't like that we find out that Elliot had been essentially raped, yet this trauma wasn't explored or dealt with in any way whatsoever. Rather, the focus was on the breakup between him and Masie.I did enjoy reading their love story as teens and seeing them reconnect in the future. If you're a die hard women's fiction reader, this book may leave you wanting more. But if you like second chance romance, then I'd recommend you give this one a go (with some reservations), especially to meet the adorable Elliot.","True","romance"

She's a toddler but she was clearly upset that her book was in pieces. I jumped on Amazon and found this listing. Some of the reviews were saying how tiny the book is and this was about half the price that was printed on the back of her old copy so I almost didn't order it. Luckily, I took a chance and two days later, Alice had an exact copy of her favorite book. She had just walked over and grabbed her old torn book and was trying to put the pieces together when I opened this package. I laid it on her old book and she smiled real big and ran off with it while I picked up and disposed of the old one. It's a legitimate issue of the book. I think they are smaller than when we were kids (wasn't it really big?) but this is still a great size especially for young kids.","True","children"

"15034","B07GX3BR7P","3","Liked, Not Loved It","","I always enjoy finding a new series by a previously, unknown to me, author.  I ""read"" this on Chirp and found it to be very well-paced.  It kept me company on my walks as I work my way to 50K.As I said, in the headline, I liked it.  Was it perfect? Maybe not.  There were some things that I found a bit far-fetched procedurally and some of Wise's actions weren't very wise or professional, considering she was a retired FBI agent.  For example, continuing to involve herself after she had been taken off the case and drawing DeMarco in as well.  Continuing to question and bait a suspect she knew was dangerous, rather than backing out and calling for back-up.  Neither are good ideas, but it seems she had a history of that kind of behavior while with the bureau.  It begs the question, ""How did she make it to retirement?""I also found her ""relationship"" with Allen, awkward in the extreme.  Their conversations were painful, but maybe that was the intention.  That kind of unease seems at odds with her very adept ability to interview and interrogate suspects.Overall, I liked Book 1 and will definitely consider more.","False","mystery"

"302","451524934","4","Remarkably timely warning about dangers of totalitarianism and ""Newspeak"" in the Age of Trump","","I re-read 1984 this summer on the Isle of Jura, a Hebridean Scottish island that is one of the most isolated and wild spots in Europe, where George Orwell wrote 1984 in an amazingly isolated house even for this isolated island. He was sick with tuberculosis that killed him shortly after he finished the book.Although some of the depiction of how a totalitarian society crushes individuality and deviations in thought are extreme and grew out of the modus operandi of the Soviet Union as they might have been applied to post-WWII England, some of his insights are scarily relevant to 2017, especially the rise of two-way communication devices that both deliver propaganda and eavesdrop on people, the benefits to the State of being in a perpetual state of war, and the use of ""newspeak"" to have the very structure of language force people to accept lies as truth.  Reminiscent of current use of the Big Lie(s) to diminish people's sense that there is such a thing as reality... one of the main character's final tests is accepting and fully believing that 2 + 2 = 5.His literary craft and style remains engaging 70 years after publication. Be warned that it is a bleak dystopian story where even the brief glimpses of happiness (such as during a very clandestine love affair) are mainly serving the purpose of making the final totalitarian intervention including physical and psychological torture all that more painful and desolate.","True","humor_entertainment"
