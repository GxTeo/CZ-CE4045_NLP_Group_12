I'm a family therapist, so I'm very choosy about the messages in children's books, and I was impressed!  The sentiment of the book is expressed though the voice of the adult story-reader who can't wait to see what wonderful things the child does and becomes.  It's a book meant to be read to a baby or young child, by a relative or close family friend, or perhaps a teacher.  It's not really the type of story book that's meant for a young child to read to himself or herself, but that's ok, because it's so perfect for the intended purpose.

I’m kind of fascinated by their lives and inspirations, what moves them and influences their music… and there’s one memoir in particular I’ve been hoping to read for what seems like forever. Dave Grohl’s The Storyteller. I am a HUGE fan, and have been since the very first time I heard “Smells Like Teen Spirit” on MTV. And yes, I may have preordered “The Storyteller” before I finished reading the press release announcing it. So you might think that my review is a little bit prejudiced -- but truthfully, he has earned every one of these stars with this well-written, completely absorbing memoir. You’ll cheer for him as he realizes his dream of becoming a touring musician, cry with him as he loses friends, family, and bandmates, and share his wonder at the incredibly blessed life he has led.The Storyteller is jam-packed with non-stop story after incredible story, and yet will still leave you wanting more and more… just like a great Foo Fighters concert.

40,1984806734,5,Laugh out loud funny & gripping romance,One person found this helpful,"Reeling from her beloved father's death and the secrets revealed at his funeral, January reluctantly moves into a beautiful house on the lake she didn't know her father owned. She's suffering from writer's block and a myriad of emotions regarding her father, only to find her writing nemesis, Gus Everett, lives next door.I *loved* this book. I read it in two great chunks - it probably would have been one, but alas, I must work. The beginning made me laugh out loud, it was so funny. But as soon as Henry starts digging deeper into January and Gus' emotions and what has happened in their lives to get them where they are, things take a more serious turn. It's also where the romance truly takes off, because they're FINALLY getting to know one another as they really are, and that means opening up about their struggles.I genuinely like January and Gus as characters, which isn't always the case with romance novels. I was rooting for them and their happy ending *so hard*. While I read these books for the happy ending, it's rare that I get so terribly invested in the romance of two characters. I would honestly read another book that's just Gus and January's domestic life together, because I really want them to be happy.It's well written and an absorbing read. For me, it was one of those books where you blink and it's 2 hours later and you really have to use the bathroom. I'll definitely reread this.",True,romance,1.0,1.0,1.0

I really struggled with this being a woman empowerment book and it focused heavily on her body and how good her body looked. I couldn’t get past that, which for me says something about the plot line!

46,B01IW9TM5O,5,there is absolutely nothing funny about the impact that colonialism and apartheid had and ...,3 people found this helpful,"Although the author of ""Born a Crime"" is a world-renowned comedian, there is absolutely nothing funny about the impact that colonialism and apartheid had and STILL have on South Africa today. Trevor Noah masterfully reminds us of how hatred became the norm during apartheid (or, more adequately, 'apart hate).  Through a system of institutionalized racism, people were separated and classified which led to a greater division in the country.Trevor Noah's quirky perspective on life lightens the tone of what is a tragic story of a country destroyed by hate. His life is spent in a sort of limbo because he is neither black nor white, but colored, which during the system was illegal. ""While most children are a symbol of their parents love, I was a sign of their criminality""  Whites did not view the blacks as  humans, and the coloreds were symbols of blatant disrespect to white authority. According to the authorities, race-mixing was more serious than treason because instead of separating the races, it shows that races want and can mix together--the ultimate betrayal to a system that has spent so much time brainwashing a society to abide by the laws of institutionalized racism.""Born a Crime"" is the story of Noah's quest to fit in, to find a place in society, and his mischievous nature leads him to become immersed in petty crime. He is first introduced to this inner ""animal instinct"" when he is thrown out of a moving car (by his mother) in an effort to save his life.  But, before you judge, remember, his existence was considered a crime due, so his mother acted quickly to protect his life. Throughout his youth, Trevor spends so much time dodging police officers solely for the crime of being born the wrong color. (However, there are quite a few comical moments when Trevor finds himself involved in innocent scams that lead to high speed chases on foot.  As he so eloquently reminds the reader, ""It is easy to be judgmental about crime when you live in a world wealthy enough to be removed from it."" He reminds us that it is only by breaking down barriers that we can truly begin to understand.Don't let Noah's use of humor fool you; ""Born a Crime"" is an essential read for anyone who wants to learn more about apartheid and life in South Africa. Trevor Noah's book is powerful because he masterfully helps the reader understand the humanity of those victimized by the system of apartheid, a critical that so many history books lack. I look forward to reading more works from this author in the future.",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

89,399587683,4,Delightful Rom-Com!,,"This was my first book of Guillory’s and I found it to be a delightful rom-com which was just what I needed in the midst of thriller and serial killer books! When Nik is proposed to on the Jumbotron at a baseball game, it’s an understatement to say she is shocked - she definitely did not see more than friends with benefits with wannabe actor Fisher - and when she turns him down, he doesn’t take it well. Cue onlooker Carlos who steps in and saves Nik from the swarm of parasites.... now given that I mentioned this is a romantic comedy, of course Nik & Carlos begin to fall for each other - but not without obstacles. The Proposal was definitely a tad predictable but sometimes that’s what you want from this genre of book and that was okay with me! I enjoyed some of the side plots like Courtney the cup cake baker badass and the girls signing up for self defense classes as well.

92,1984806734,4,"It was fun and made me laugh, but it also had some great serious and thoughtful moments.",,"This new release has been hyped all over the internet. I was interested immediately from the synopsis. A book about a writer that’s stuck? Count me in.We follow January, a romance writer who has learned some things about her parents that have shaken her idea of happily ever after. She’s moved into a beach house that she didn’t know her father owned so she can pack it up and sell it. This is a hugely emotional thing for her, but at the same time, she’s supposed to be writing her next book by the end of the summer. The only problem with this is that she hasn’t even started and when she tries, she has no ideas. Things get interesting when she realizes who her neighbor is.Augustus Everett is a fellow writer, one that January actually went to college with. I really liked him from the start. It was immediately clear that these two had certain assumptions about one another that weren’t really true. So, Gus and January make a deal where Gus will spend the summer writing a romance novel and January will write literary fiction. I loved that this became sort of cathartic for January. She used this new challenge to try to work through all of the things she has going on in her life. I just really enjoyed the writing aspects of the story. I also totally loved the flirtation that was included for some of the writing parts. Also, as a part of their deal, the two adventured together. Friday nights they would go somewhere that Gus had previously planned for book research and January would take Gus on field trips that one might find in a romance novel. I loved these because they were both so different. So, Fridays they’d deal with some really heavy stuff and Saturdays they would go to the carnival or something. It was an interesting contrast; the darkness of what Gus was researching with the fun date-like adventures that January planned.Overall, I really enjoyed this book just as much as everyone else. It was fun and made me laugh, but it also had some great serious and thoughtful moments. I found myself easily invested in the characters and their relationships.

I go way, way back when it comes to this author, back to a book called Beautiful Bastard where I met Bennett, it was love at first read. Since then I have read many books from Ms. Lauren and adore her books because of the incredible way she writes them.This book is no different, as a matter of fact (I can’t believe I’m typing this) this book is almost right up there to my adoration and love for Bennett. In this book, Elliott captured my heart rather quickly. This is a love story that has so much depth, you want to teleport yourself into this world and be a part of all the action. It’s a complicated story that goes from past to present and back to past again. Reading these types of book always allows me to think even more, I did a lot of thinking while reading. When you read this book and are introduced to these characters, get ready to take an astonishing ride of your reading life.What was it that kept me thinking the whole time??That’s easy, this isn’t just your simple love story read.It’s about jumping off into the water and praying you stay afloat. Macy and Elliott are the star characters that are treading water. They share a past, a very intriguing past that leads them to this point where these characters are at an impasse in present day. Do they sink or swim in the end - the question that I honestly kept trying to figure out because during so much of this book I kept trying to predict the rest of the story, as I was reading it!! I never came to the conclusion that I received when I finished it, just trust me when I say, the book was far better than any prediction I came up with.So a big YES to recommending this book to all - thank you Christina Lauren for taking me away once again from everyday stress and inviting me into your world of awesome!

The characters both thought and spoke in ways that real people do not. Besides the dialogue, the rest of the book was just as poorly written. There were so many paragraphs that did nothing to help the story at all that could have been just left out entirely. Take the part at the end where the ex comes to Nik’s door and she punches him. It was incredibly random and just so terribly written it was almost laughable.  Additionally, the plot was not only predictable but incredibly boring. The only semi interesting thing that happened was the proposal in the first chapter and then it all went downhill. I didn’t find any of the characters particularly likable. I could go on and on but take my word for it and don’t waste your money!",True,romance,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0

197,786965606,5,Like many reviewers here,9 people found this helpful,"Like many reviewers here, I'm one of the old-timers who started playing AD&D 1st edition back in the dark ages of 1981 or so and played the game extensively as both a player and a DM for many years.  I had invested so much in the 1st edition books, modules, etc. that I was frankly never interested in the subsequent editions.  Fast forward to 2017.  I hadn't played D&D in a number of years and a group of like-minded co-workers who had previous experience with various iterations of the game decided that we would like to get a gaming group together.  After more than a year of talking about doing it without actually doing it, I finally took the bull by the horns and said ""OK, here's the date and time at my house.  Let's stop talking about playing and just play.""  I decided to buy both the 5e Starter Set and this new Player's Handbook to see what had become of my beloved game.  Bottom line, I think Wizards of the Coast has absolutely knocked it out of the park.  For me, all the feel of the original edition is here, but with a much more organized, coherent and logical rules structure.  Combat, the magic system, treasure, artifacts, most everything is here from the 1st edition (including Unearthed Arcana) and more, but with a much more playable rules system and a lot of the deadwood cut away (I mean who the heck ever used things like the Unearthed Arcana cantrip ""Freshen"" for crying out loud?)  If you're still a 1st edition purist, skeptical like I was, at LEAST get the Start Set and give it a read through.  It won't take you more than an hour to wrap your head around the core of the new rules and I promise you, you WILL want to buy the Player's Handbook and delve more completely into the new edition.  Now when I go back and compare to the original PHB, the improvements are obvious and the overall design and production quality of the new book is manifestly evident.  Gone are the myriad of various tables and arbitrary rules for every little thing and instead a simple, easy-to-apply set of rules. largely based on the d20 roll that really cuts back on time at the gaming table spent paging through the book trying to figure out ""how do I do this?"" and put your time back where it belongs:  in the world of adventure.  Our newly-formed group has already played two marathon sessions in our first campaign and we are set for another session soon.  The bug has bitten and we are all freshly resurrected hard-core D&D players again.  My experience with this new edition and my new group has already resulted in the purchase 4 or 5 more new Player's Handbooks among the members of my gaming group.  Is 5th edition perfect?  Certainly not, but no system is and as Gary Gygax himself would no doubt say, the rules are in the end just guides, not graven in stone.  If something doesn't work for your group, change it up.  Fortunately with 5th edition, rare is the time so far I've done that and I'm blessed with a group of 7 excellent players who are NOT dreaded ""rules lawyers"" anyway.

Every decision is about him and what he did to the family and it got old after awhile. And Gus, even with his heartache and awful childhood, it was hard to sympathize with him sometimes.

Coming from someone who has experienced domestic violence in the past it really hits home. When I first bought this book I didn't know what to except, but it wasn't this. It was everything I could've hoped for and MORE. I loved the way she portrayed Lily. She was so courageous, bold, relatable and perfect in all the right ways. I cannot wait for book 2!!!

Second, did you even read the book? Lily clearly states her confusion with either staying or leaving. It's not like she was staying with him because she liked the abuse?! Some of yawl's reviews seriously get to me. Imagine falling in love with someone who was absolutely perfect in your eyes and treated you in all the ways you'd ever imagine. You then get tied down... He starts to abuse you... Does things to you that you never thought this man who loved you SO much could possibly do?!? But it happens. It's not that easy to up in leave... If you TRULY knew what it is like to experience domestic abuse you would know that. So please stop getting mad at Lily for taking so long to leave! The whole thing about her getting with Atlas so fast after the whole dealio with Ryle ended, was PERFECT in my eyes.

262,1451673310,4,A classic for a reason,5 people found this helpful,"Damn, what a rush this book was. I went into this novel hearing all the hype about how great it is and the great debate around the book’s central theme and it didn’t disappoint. Fahrenheit 451 to me wasn’t merely about censorship or the soul sucking effects of the “idiot box.” To me, Fahrenheit 451 is also a story about willful ignorance. A future world where everyone is content to waste their lives away in front of a television screen, to never think, to never be challenged, and to never give a second thought to their fellow man. It isn’t just books that the citizens of the future are no longer interested in – folks don’t seem to be all that interested in anything. The character I found most interesting was Mildred – she and the other wives are like little clucking hens that sit around the house all day. They are shining examples of what the world had become: apathetic and self absorbed. They lived within their own echo chambers and willingly ignored the terrible things going on around them.Although the central message of this book has done well to stand the test of time even to the present day, I will note that several elements of the story felt like they are becoming quite dated. The obvious absence of the internet, the fears of nuclear war, and of course the wives that never work being the social norm. It’s clear that the book was written during the Cold War era, so it might make things seem a little bit odd for younger audiences.I had some difficulty with the narration, primarily Guy Montag’s thoughts which to me seemed nonsensical or incoherent at times, but I figured that was intentional given the setting. The plot flew by so quickly and by the end I felt like I had whiplash. The story has a pretty even flow and then… BOOM. The story suddenly speeds up and dives into an action packed ending. Despite my issues, the book still hits hard and gave me a lot to think about. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and had a difficult time putting it down.",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

The later portions provide interesting stories about finding his way during the transition from an apartheid where there was no place for him to a post-apartheid country where no one knew their place. But the real power is in the early chapters that lay the foundation for his dissociation. Trevor Noah writes about racial oppression and white privilege with an honesty and insight available only to someone who not only has experienced both but has experienced being whipsawed back and forth between them by a system that had no place to put him.South Africa must have some pretty solid statutes of limitation. In this book Noah freely admits to crimes from shoplifting to recording piracy. But when your very existence is a crime worse than murder, you don't sweat the small stuff.In one chapter, he talks about the genius of apartheid and how the ability to move up from Black to Colored to White kept everyone off balance and at one another's throats. I would tend to think of it as an uninteded effect of the insane logic of thinking you can classify everyone. But Noah helped me see that it was much more intentional and sinister than I gave it credit for. When I read poetry that has a possible interpretation beyond the surface meaning, I always give the poet the benefit of the doubt that it was done intentionally. Trevor Noah has forced me to do the same for the architects of apartheid.",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

277,1984806734,5,A Must Read for this Summer!!!,,"Oh my dear God, this book! For starters, BEACH READ, in my opinion, is NOT a beach read at all. It’s nothing like a fluffy, swoon-worthy, super light and fun summer read like I expected (or as the title and cover implied); instead, it’s a book about sad, tragic pasts, ugly lies, and dirty family secrets.That being said, I really appreciate that there's much more depth in the character development and overall plot design. The protagonists, January and Gus, are determined to find their ways back to their truest selves through a string of bad lucks, terrible incidents, and harsh truths they're left no choice but to accept. Interestingly, as a rom-com and general fiction author respectively, January and Gus make a deal challenge each other to jump out of their comfort zones by switching their genres and each of them have to write a book in the genre they're most unfamiliar with. In short, January has to write a general fiction book instead of her favorite happily-ever-after whereas Gus needs to brainstorm a heartfelt, swoon-worthy story filled with pink bubbles. *giggles*Needless to say, this book is indeed a breath of fresh air with such an original story idea and unforgettable characters. January and Gus are both so different yet share a wicked sense of humor I can't get enough of. On a cooler note, the initial inspiration of this book is actually from Emily Henry's experience of a writer's block! In the acknowledgement, Emily reveals that since she has no idea what to write in the first place, why not write about the struggle of a writer's block? And I'm in awe, seriously, because this book turns out to be one of the BEST READS I've had this year so far!The story itself is on point and perfectly written, however, the only complaint I have for this book is the cover and book title. Not only are they utterly irrelevant to the storyline, there's no way I'd pick this book up had I judged it by its cover. Thankfully, the synopsis piques my curiosity more than the odd cover/title and I'm so, so, so happy I come across this book. :DAll in all, HIGHLY RECOMMEND Beach Read to all of you!! I'm sure you'll love January and Gus's writing/living journey as much as I do. This book truly far exceeds my expectation and I can't recommend it enough! If you ever got a chance to read it, please let me know what you think. I'd love to have someone to chat about this beautiful story. *wink*",False,romance,1.0,1.0,1.0

It looks at their struggle to take over and operate the farm where they live and the opposition that they face from an oppressive master and a hostile world.But as you know, Animal Farm is also a harsh political satire. Its target is not socialism per se (George Orwell was a committed socialist). The target is authoritarian (and populist?) government in general, and the Soviet Union in particular. Orwell took a lot of heat for his criticism of the USSR but, of course, history has shown him to be right. I think that this book remains quite relevant to today's readers in today's world.

Enter Augustus Everett, yet another author, who January has actually had a prior acquaintance with in college. When they meet, they decide to strike up a deal to help one another with their writing blocks.This book was such a hilarious rom-com! I enjoyed it so much and was definitely reaching for tissues to wipe my tears of laughter away at a point or two and let it be known, it takes a lot to make me laugh. I absolutely loved Gus–he was such an intriguing character who made me laugh and cry at the same time.Both characters struggle with a lot of internal difficulties from various relationships in their life but as they embark on different research adventures together, it's hard not to notice the undeniable pull between them. Picking up on strings left off years ago definitely is not easy, and neither is their relationship, but it's described in such a beautiful way that you can't help but root for these two all the way until the end.This story is told from just January's perspective, and while I usually am a fan of dual POV, this kept my attention the whole time and I didn't feel that having only one perspective took away from the story in any way.

Nothing about this feels like Nikole, and when she finally gives her answer, more than one person is less than pleased. Carlos and his sister witness the whole proposal from a few rows up and quickly swoop in to rescue Nikole from the approaching camera crew. Away from the stadium and a few laughs/drinks later, a spark between Nikole and Carlos begins, leaving them both wishing for more time together.I love books where two people are obviously in love but refuse to see it themselves. Nikole and Carlos were both very likable characters and I found myself equally rooting for each. I loved that this story is about a mixed-race couple surrounded by a multiethnic cast.

Obvious after reading about a gourmet cupcake shop, I had to go out and get myself a half dozen from a local place,  @cupcakeroyale .This is the second novel I have read by Guillory from her “Wedding Date” series, but you can easily read this book as a stand-alone. Carlos actually appears as the supportive best friend in the first book, so I loved how this was an entirely new storyline separate from Drew and Alexa’s story, but still loosely connected.This had girl power, spunk, and body positive messages for women, while allowing space for male characters to show their feelings.

A bet to swap genres and see who gets published first.The risk? In telling each other's stories, their worlds might be changed entirely…The Beach Read is written in 1st person with January being our narrator. The style of writing is easy to get on with and the chapters average about 10 pages each - so they aren't that long. The book deals with a lot of issues, such as grief, infidelity, divorce, love etc. So much so, that I don't think it's a typical rom com book, this book felt much more real than that. There is also no fade to black on the sex scenes, which were detailed.I enjoyed this book. I loved the characters of January and Gus and they were very realistic and relatable to me.

Mas esse começo “mais trabalhoso” para o leitor é totalmente compensado pelo tema central e o desenvolvimento da trama. A estória é contada sob o ponto de vista da protagonista January, uma jovem escritora que passa por uma crise pessoal após a perda do pai.Nesse momento penoso de sua vida, January acaba sendo vizinha de Gus (o seu nemesis do período de college). E esse relacionamento de amor-e-ódio vai, aos poucos se transformar em amizade-amor.Se para mim January sozinha não funcionou satisfatoriamente, January e Gus formam um casal perfeito. Suas personalidades diferentes acabam se revelando complementares e suas estórias de vida, aparentemente tão contrastantes se mostram muitíssimo similares.Este sumário definitivamente não faz justiça à qualidade de Beach Read. Romance, humor, emoção, está tudo aqui.

I understand use of profanity is part of making the characters realistic, but I think the character development would have happened without so much colorful language.  I usually like books employing a back and forth in time style; however, I often had difficulty telling when certain events took place.  The past and present  events seemed to jump all over the place on a single page or within the same paragraph.  It is a book selection for our book club later in the year.  I am afraid at least one member will not read the book past the first few pages due to the language.  Others will read it for the discussion value as we compare it to our own experiences in the American South and the differences in American regional racial attitudes.  Our group is neither  ethnically nor gender diverse, though several grew up in different areas of the country, greatly affecting perception and personal experiences.  It would be interesting to hear a male perspective.  Trevor's mother was hard for me to relate to as I saw her as a compilation of contradictions.  That may have been the author's point as he attempted to paint a picture of her for the reader. I do believe the book club group will be critical of the writing style and its general lack of flow or transition. I have a friend who lived in South Africa for many years.

457,451524934,4,The Holy Trinity of Dystopian Literature?,10 people found this helpful,"This is a book that I've seen lumped in with Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451. One reviewer I saw actually referred to this trio as the Holy Trinity of dystopian literature. I like the comparison, because I really like all three. But I find it difficult to imagine a Holy Trinity of dystopia without The Stand in there. I guess it depends on your definition though. Maybe The Stand is more ""apocalyptic"" than dystopian.Anyway, I read The Gulag Archipelago last year, and Volume One thoroughly detailed the practices of the Soviet Union in the days following the Revolution. Many of the practices of the government of Oceania (the fictional superpower under whose boot the protagonist, Winston Smith, lives) remind me of the descriptions given by Solzhinytsyn of the Soviet Union. For example, Oceania had programs where children were taught to snitch on their parents if they spoke poorly of the state. There was also the concept of strictly controlling the flow of information. One of the things I'll never forget from The Gulag Archipelago is the torture techniques used by the Soviet prison guards. They would crush men's testicles among other terrible acts that I don't even want to think about. This is common practice in Oceania as well. It's interesting just how much Orwell understood the inner-workings of the Soviet Union even when other parts of the world were still in denial about what they were up to over there.It's a sad ending. You just want to see Winston hold up to the torture, but he doesn't. Then when he's released, you just want to see him track down his girlfriend and run off to the wilderness somewhere and live the rest of their lives together in solitude, but they don't. In the end, they're both broken and become servants of the state. In the end, Winston does everything that is asked of him and he's still shot in the head.",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

I started with 1.0 and 1.5 books as a kid then got into 3.5 as a teenager. Now as an adult i am trying out 5.0. I like the fact that the 5.0 books return to a bit more streamlined way of playing, much like 1.5. I don't like that the classes are so much more overpowered and restricted. You can't make a bad character, not really. You can't mix and match and customize as much as 3.5 but 3.5 and pathfinder both went a bit crazy with all the subsets and extra rules. I found this player's handbook to be a bit sparse on fun stuff and it involves a lot of back and forthing when setting up a character.That being said, once you make your character the book is well laid out and easy to use. I do like how the spell lists are arranged not only alphabetically by class but also by spell in general. Much preferable to the clunkier model used by 3.5.Packaging was fine.

If you're reading these reviews then chances are you know the plot or the book and don't need it retold here, so I wont.I WILL, however mention that while the story is amazing, the eBook is not great.

486,1542046599,1,More gripes than hypes,One person found this helpful,"This is the first book I’ve read by this author and thought I would roll the dice and give her a try.  The first thing that bothered me was that the story felt choppy. Not just because there doesn’t seem to be a very clear main character to follow or that you are following several people at once from different perspectives but also because each chapter ends in a  cliff hanger leaving the reader unsatisfied throughout the whole book. As a result of the writing style I didn’t feel connected to any of the characters at all. You do get the whole story but end up having to piece the bits together to end up with a coherent picture. Like making a shirt from 5 different materials. The majority of the book is spent detailing dead end story lines with no payout to the reader. The book pretty much ends in the middle of an action scene in a cliff hanger.  The epilogue does wrap up some questions but doesn’t even really address all the characters you spend the whole book following. The epilogue seemed like a rushed afterthought to answer questions and give info that would have been better served actually being addressed in the plot. One of my biggest gripes about this book is definitely how the female characters were all portrayed. For some reason (and surprisingly so because it is a female author) all the female characters come off as feeble, emotionally unstable and lash out or act strictly on impulse. Not to have a reasonable normal female character was a thorn in my side. The friend, the sister, the mother, the witness, even the female DI lashes out at her coworker and is put on suspension (even if it’s only mentioned in passing). The whole book was utterly disappointing. My last gripe is that the author tends to drawl on about flies and farm life and flowers which have nothing to offer the book except act as page filler. It’s a waste really because the bones of a good story are there but it’s a bit like watching a person waste their talent.",True,mystery,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0

It's WAY overly wordy though and makes simple concepts like how to calculate rolls much more complicated than a simple google search will explain.PROS:Artwork is pretty awesome, and gets the creative juices goingClear and thorough outline of player classesCONS:Player race descriptions are very brief. In a book with over 300 pages, most classes have only 2-3 pages dedicated (including illustrations)The explanation of gameplay mechanics is VERY scattered and difficult to piece together. I am constantly looking in the index and running through 4-5 chapters to get a full explanation of most concepts.Could be much more concise, and therefore, much shorter.There is no simple approach for this book... it's ""Read it all... then read it all again... then understand it""... there isn't a way to read through it in a way that gets you started in a simplified way, or a way to read the concepts as you'd approach them in the game.OVERALL:As I said it's basically a necessity, especially if you are interested in how to build a character and or interested in the classes that the starter set does not cover. It is difficult to approach for a new player and has the concepts (like calculating AC, or when that calculation is to be applied) are either scattered so much it takes a quest to find them, or may just not be present at all.

But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. “What if…” “If only…” “I wonder what would have…” You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days.""""We got to where we were, but none of it ever came from a place of self-pity. “Learn from your past and be better because of your past,” she would say, “but don’t cry about your past. Life is full of pain. Let the pain sharpen you, but don’t hold on to it. Don’t be bitter.” And she never was. The deprivations of her youth, the betrayals of her parents, she never complained about any of it.""People with determination are those who get up and keep going, who learn from what went wrong and adjust course, and who believe in themselves despite all obstacles.""Trevor Noah, Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

586,B01IW9TM5O,5,Angela's Ashes in South Africa,One person found this helpful,"What an amazing story! Trevor Noah, who replaced Jon Stewart as late night host, has told the story of his growing up years in South Afica. Let me just say, it is an incredible story! Each chapter recounts an episode or a time in his life. Not knowing much about South Africa, I learned a great deal about apartheid, and the adjustment that followed when it was dismissed. I learned about the racism, the poverty, the different languages, tribes and cultures. I learned about life threatening violence, and about why Trevor's title is so apt.But, all of this is told very truthfully, but with a forgiving spirit, sprinkled with humor, as the droll Noah does in his comedy routines. There is disappointment , disagreement, mischief, rage and the most intense pain one could feel. All is well written and well explained. There is emotion, history, the journey to adulthood, the family spirit, and even religious experience. The time toured in this memoir of a young boy growing up in South Africa, contrasts what readers in the US may have experienced growing up, with Noah's very different experience. However, there is the thread of common human experience, so well woven throughout.In short, this is a very worthy book which I highly recommend. If you haven't seen Trevor Noah, do tune in to his show and or check him out on You Tube. The book, the tv show, and any videos of him, will amaze you, once you have learned his story.

The other review that discusses the choppy sentences and how they affect the flow of the book was spot on. There were other minor grammatical (stylistic?) issues that bothered me: using single quotations for conversations instead of double quotations and missing periods after abbreviations. It just seemed like a lack of attention to detail. The story culminated in the least gripping scene I've read in a mystery/thriller, like the author was rushing to get it over with. There were subplots that took up half of chapters that still don't seem relevant to the story. Each chapter was from a different character's perspective, and more and more characters were the star of their own chapter, which was odd. Overall, it felt like the author took a short story and stretched it out into a novel. A novel with choppy, stream of consciousness sentences, random subplots, and cliffhangers at the end of every chapter.

12,1451673310,4,You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.,14 people found this helpful,"My Rating: Put it on your list Level: Quick and easy read, fairly short. SummaryAway in the dark near future, there is a still a profession called 'fireman', but they don't save houses from burning (houses are fireproof now), but now they start fires. Not for houses, but for books. The book follows the story of one of these firemen as he starts to question why they are doing what they do, and instead starts saving and hiding books. After he is found out, he becomes the victim of the system he used to be a part of. My ThoughtsThis is a classic of dystopian fiction. The scary thing is, though some elements are over the top, much is too accurate. Bradburry rightly predicts (originally published in 1951) that books won't be banned by the government or people in the majority for challenging the status quo, but instead, books will be questioned or banned for offending some group or another. We see this happening today, especially with elements of history that people do not like. He also predicted the heavy use of what are basically headphones. I went for a walk this morning and noticed every one of the dozen or so people I saw had headphones in. As a big book-reader and someone who isn't paranoid about the government, I see Bradburry's vision as much more accurate than something like 1984. He was even wrong that the government would actively burn books by the will/request of the people. We don't have to worry about that now, people just stopped reading them. Hell, people buy digital books, so you can't even burn them anyway. But it doesn't matter, in the most recent Pew study (2014) 23% of people hadn't read a book in the past year. That's up from 8% in 1978, the first year they asked. The median number of books read a year by American adults is 4. We don't need to burn book, and the government doesn't need to ban them. We are doing this to ourselves. We have 100 of channel showing pointless shit on TV and endless ways to stalk people we don't even like on facebook and twitter, who needs books?Maybe his most accurate portrayal was related to this. One of the characters in the book, whom the police watch due to being 'peculiar', lives in the only house that doesn't glow blue at night. The family has their lights on and can be seen through the window sitting around talking, everyone else has their lights off and is watching TV, so that only a low, flickering blue color can be seen from the street. Where he is wrong is that no one thinks it odd now, but most people likely never think about it. I know I never did, but now if I walk around at night, I notice all the windows from the back of the houses and some of the bedrooms are dark and flickering blue. It becomes kind of eerie if you look or think about it too much.   Anyway, over all, the book is a bit over-dramatic at times, well not being dramatic enough in others, due to un-imagined technological change. The concepts are great and the portrayal of why life could be like in this dystopian future is frighteningly accurate at times. I as I said above, it is a classic in the genre, and a book to put on your reading list. More reviews - MondayMorningTheolgian.com",True,humor_entertainment,0.0,0.0,0.0

Noah’s ability to reflect on how his life fit into the greater fabric of apartheid and the aftermath was exceptional. I particularly enjoyed his portrayal of his mother.The only thing that didn’t really work for me was the somewhat disjointed nature of the storyline.  I understand that this came from essays, which helps explain it a bit, but it didn’t seem like separate essays.  It seemed like a generally cohesive story that occasionally jumped around. This was particularly problematic toward the end, when he had finished high school, had a job, lost the job, then <bam> let’s talk about how my mother and stepfather met when I was 9. I get that he likely wanted to present that whole story about their relationship at once, for dramatic effect...? But I felt a little confused sometimes about WHEN certain events were occurring, which kind of took me “out” of the story.Just as an aside, I also wished that there was more about how he made it OUT of poverty. It felt like one minute he’s selling bootlegged CDs on a street corner, and the next he’s a comedian. I think part of what is remarkable about his story is that he came from such meager circumstances and managed to climb out and achieve great success. It’s inspiring, to be sure. But also confusing because it is kind of glossed over.All in all, though, it’s clear to see that this was a very personal work for Trevor Noah.

I loved reading this book to my young students (18 months through kindergarten) and they paid rapt attention.  They enjoy the colorful and original art.  And they like the sing-song rhyme of the text.While it says the book is for children two to five years of age, I think you can read it as soon as a child is ready for books like 6 months or possibly younger. Young children can begin to learn colors, numbers and letter sounds from birth.  I used to recite the letter sounds with accompanying letter pictures (a for apple) to my sons, and by age age two they knew all of their letter sounds, by three they were reading words and by four they were reading books.  Also did counting and color activities and books with them. They knew the colors by the age of two as I read books like this one to them and played color games with them.Early learning, when done with a non-pressured and joyous, happy approach is wonderful for young children as their minds are so absorbent.  They want to learn, are wired to learn and don't distinguish between learning and play. If they can learn to speak a foreign language in six months at the age of four when it takes an adult years, it is clear their minds are like a sponge at these young ages.  Books that teach while entertain, like this one, are wonderful.  This book is a classic book for young children.",True,children,1.0,1.0,1.0

Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed with this book.  I always finish what I start, so I did muddle through and found the last quarter of the book to be better than the previous.  The minute details of things that had no baring on the story line was the most frustrating and seemed to drag out the plot.  I understand descriptive writing, but do we really care what colors are being used in every flower arrangement made?  Lots of characters with back stories that really never tied together and had nothing to do with the plot, i.e. The Witness' son getting his girlfriend pregnant (why was that even in there?).  Guess I'm just not a fan of this writing style and sorry to say, this was definitely not my cup of tea..",True,mystery,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0
135,1984806734,4,4 Stars - Really good,9 people found this helpful,"I just wasn't sure about this one when I requested it. The cover is that stinking animated trend that I really dislike. I don't always read adult books due to potential content, but I've learned that just because a book is labeled adult doesn't mean it has to include graphic content. I'm not familiar with this author (although I am interested in looking into her other books). But the description had a few things going for it that pulled me in. I loved that both main characters are authors, and I also liked their bet/challenge about stepping out of their normal genres to write something different.January is disillusioned. Her father recently passed away, and on the day of his funeral she found out that he'd had an affair while her mother was fighting cancer. And her long-term boyfriend couldn't handle her journey through grief and betrayal. Struggling with writing anything romance-driven, she's in a financial bind as well. So January moves temporarily into her father's lake house to empty it and sell it...while also writing a book.January quickly realizes that her next-door neighbor is Gus Everett who she went to college with. Back then, Gus repeatedly criticized her writing because of her perpetual happy endings. He also chose to only critique her during class which caused a lot of resentment. Yet there's always another side to the story.I loved the insight we're given into the writing and even briefly into the publishing process. This isn't too detailed. It didn't take over the story, but I think Emily Henry included just the right amount of both the story January was writing and the process itself.Gus was endearing. He's awkward. He sees the world in a darker way than January does. Yet he's drawn to her light. There was not much that I didn't like about Gus.I don't always address this because I feel like I would be repeating myself in 90% of my reviews, but there were certainly many moral decisions in this book that I don't personally support. My thoughts on many of these things the majority of our country would consider outdated, but that doesn't change the fact that I hold to a different moral standard than the average American (or so it seems these days).Favorite quotes:-It wasn’t that I couldn’t get enough of him. Or that he was the best man I’d ever known. (I’d thought that was my dad, but now it was the dad from my favorite 2000s teen drama, Veronica Mars.) Or that he was my favorite person. (That was Shadi.) Or because he made me laugh so hard I wept. (He laughed easily, but rarely joked.) Or that when something bad happened, he was the first person I wanted to call. (He wasn’t.) It was that we met at the same age my parents had, that the snowball fight and impromptu road trip had felt like fate, that my mother adored him. He fit so perfectly into the love story I’d imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life.-Anger with all the broken parents, heartache that they too must’ve felt like kids—helpless, unsure how to make the right decisions, terrified of making the wrong ones.-“You don’t believe in any kind of internal moral compass.” The way he said it made it seem as if he himself did believe in such a thing, which would’ve surprised me a few weeks ago, but now made perfect sense. “Maybe you start out with that,” she said, “But if you do, it gets shaped as you age. How are you supposed to believe right’s right and wrong’s wrong if everyone around you says the opposite? You’re supposed to think you’re smarter than all of them?”-“You don’t know the difference between pity and sympathy,” I said. “I’m not pitying you. It makes me sad to think of you being treated like that. It makes me mad to think you didn’t have the things all kids deserve. And yeah, it makes me mad and sad that a lot of people go through the things you went through, but it’s even more upsetting because it’s you. And I know you and I like you and I want you to have a good life. That’s not pity. That’s caring about someone.”-You make beautiful things, because you love the world, and maybe the world doesn’t always look how it does in your books, but … I think putting them out there, that changes the world a little bit. And the world can’t afford to lose that.”These quotes remind me of a few things I want to mention. The second quote is a reminder that I now read from a parental figure's point of view just as much as the main character. I can't turn it off. The third reminds me that I can't base what I believe to be right or wrong upon myself or anyone else or even a large collection of others. God's Word will always be my moral compass. I have and will fall short. But I at least have a guide that does not waver. The fourth is a pet peeve of mine. Characters in books often disdain what they perceive as pity, but sympathy is usually what's being extended to them by people who care. And those people don't have to be in their close inner circle to care. For the last quote, I fancy seeing myself writing a book one day. And if I ever do, I hope that my characters or my world might not be realistic so much as hopeful or portrayals of what can be.Beach Read was much better than I expected it to be. I really enjoyed the process of the relationship between Gus and January. I appreciated her journey through grief and beginning to heal. I also liked the information surrounding writing, the process, and the publishing side we get to see. I do have to say that I didn't love the information dump in the form of letters January's father wrote to her before he died. Beach Read gets 4 Stars. Have you read Beach Read? What did you think?

150,451524934,5,The Futility of Resistance,2 people found this helpful,"1984 was written in 1949 during the Cold War and the great fear of the communist invasion. It was rumored that communist spies were living amongst our society and threatened our very way of life. 1984 displays a powerful warning of what fear can lead to. This novel proves to maintain its relevancy even in today’s society, as we fear constant government surveillance under the guise of fighting the war on terror. The novel is not for children as it depicts scenes of torture. George Orwell’s 1984 has become the epitome of a dystopian society.George Orwell’s classic 1984 centers on the totalitarian control of Oceania. Citizens of Oceania live under constant surveillance from the “telescreens” and microphones placed everywhere from their house to place of work. Any facial expression that might show a feeling of distaste towards the “Party” in control will result in arrest, interrogation, and ultimately execution by the “Thought Police.” Even the children are taught espionage and to betray their parents at any sign of dissent from the “Party.” Individuality has been completely eradicated because any perceived eccentricity means certain death.The “Party” has complete control over the history that is presented to its citizens. They use this control to create the image of an infallible presence. Any contradiction to their word will be rewritten to portray the party in the correct manner. Because of the complete control that the “Party” has over its citizens, anything they say instantly becomes fact. The “Party” tells people that 2+2=5 and they unquestionably accept it as the truth. The “Party” seeks complete control over its citizen’s thoughts and even goes so far as to attempt to eradicate the orgasmOceania is constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia and changes throughout the novel. When the enemy changes, the history books are rewritten so that Oceania is always at war with the one enemy. This constant state of war is used to keep the citizens of Oceania in fear of the outside world. Public executions of captured enemy combatants are to dehumanize the enemy and show that only “Party” members are human.The protagonist, Winston Smith, lives with distaste of the “Party”. After engaging in an unauthorized affair with Julia, the two of them seek out the rumored resistance to the “Party”. This resistance proves to be futile as they are both arrested by the “Thought Police” very quickly. After months of torture, Winston completely conforms and accepts that 2+2=5 and that he loves Big Brother.",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

I borrowed it from the library when this is one that 100% deserves to be purchased.It was utterly wonderful. I adored this book! I love the MCs imperfections. I loved that they knew each other but not really years before. I loved that he was smitten with her back in the day! (I honestly skipped ahead and found this out, but I didn’t even care because it made him so much more endearing.) It's 1st Person, FMC's POV, slow burn, dare I say, grump/grump trope? The romance was so sweet. It was subtle in the perfect places--the kind that is begging to be reread so you can soak everything up. This is a book that lived up to the damn hype, and I have almost no complaints.This book is absolutely Women's Fiction though. This is not a romance. This has a heavy romance, no lie, but this is Women's Fiction with Romance. The author mentions in the acknowledgments that she tells other writers that this book is about writer's block. Not the romance. It's also very wordy. Like, overwritten, over described, heavy inner monologue which really speaks to women's fiction more than romance as a genre. The plot of them switching genres begins on page 80 of 360ish, so it's a very slow moving plot. But it is incredibly developed. The A plot mixes seamlessly with the B and C plots. You can't have one without the other and I really appreciated that. The plots are also really heavy, again, more women's lit than romance.The back story is really told, not shown, but it is told in a more compelling way than straight true info dumping, and it's told it a beautiful manner. I felt like some of the chapter endings were random. Like, oh crap, gotta cap this chapter now and start the new one. It wasn't distracting too much; it just felt weird. Weirder though, was the choice to have sex--multiple times--outside of a burned down cult site. Like, MMC brought condoms for that outting when he hadn't had them for their other sexytime. So. It was clearly a choice. Unless they stopped using condoms, but given the mention of them . . . it just wasn't the sexiest choice in the world.I loved this book.

Ignoring anything about the new system introduced by Wizards of the Coast.  The book is nice.  Illustrations are pretty although not necessary.  It reads like you could actually play basic adventures with just this book as there are some basic beasts (monsters) given in the book.  It is broken up into 3 sections.  The first one and largest one being character creation, which has always been the meat of Player's Handbooks.  The second one pertains to adventuring rules, which I was surprised to find in this book and not have to wait for the DM Guide to get.  The last section is magic which is just your standard how to use and then a compiled list of spells.  The big problem about the book is the cross-referencing.  The pages all have the page number and section number on the bottom, but NOT the chapter numbers.  And whenever you come across a rule in the text that is addressed somewhere else in the book, the book tells you to ""see CHAPTER XX.""  In this case you have no quick way to find said rule.  First you have to find the chapter by actually going through the book and then you have to page through the chapter and scan every page until you find the reference.  This problem would have been highly reduced and easily fixed by listing the chapter number on the bottom of pages (No one cares about the section number), or with a little bit of extra work by referencing the exact page the rule is on (i.e. ""see page XX"").

Each writer agrees to write a book in the other’s genre.But, since Gus doesn’t have much experience with happily ever afters and January needs research for her work, they agree on regular outings to educate each other on the necessary elements of each genre.The thing is, these “research outings” start to look a lot like dates.And January and Augustus find it increasingly harder to pretend that they don’t enjoy each other’s company.Enemies to lovers is one of my favorite romance tropes, and Beach Read is a fun example of just how entertaining it is when done well.I would say that Augustus and January’s coming together was less due to character development and more to them dropping the pretenses and being vulnerable to each other. While I love to see some transformation in the main characters, the book still had them come together in a satisfying way.This book had lots of gems for bibliophiles, some literary jokes had me nearly spitting out the margarita I was sipping while reading this by the pool. There were a number of cheesy moments, but Henry embraces them and they work to make this a fun romantic comedy.What the book was not?Sappy. With a character that’s a self-professed romantic at heart, albeit a temporarily disillusioned one, it could have easily gone the other direction. I’m glad Henry keeps it in check and makes things believable between the two characters.A few minor characters really stood out as well.The pacing of this book worked well. The plot moved along at a pace to keep you reading and engaged, while still giving the feel of long summer days.My main criticisms of the book are that I’d have liked to see more character growth and exploration of some of the deeper themes the book discusses. A bit more balance between the romance and literary fiction that the characters write, if you will. But for escapism, this book is hard to beat.",False,romance,1.0,1.0,1.0

I can't stop recommending it to people, even my guy friends.After reading the author's note I'm not sure how anyone can consider this anything but a masterpiece. ""When friends ask me what Beach Read is about, I tell them it's about a disillusioned romance author and a literary fiction writer who make a deal to swap genres for the summer. When other writers ask me what Beach Read is about, I tell them it's about writer's block."" Personally, I think I would describe this as a complicated adult contemporary romance about two authors finding solace in each other at a time where they are both dealing with a lot of emotional baggage.I understand why some reviews say this wasn't the type of romance they were expecting. The cover and title are a bit misleading. This is definitely not a light and fun summer read. There's a big focus on writing and craft, a book about writing a book you could say, but it also examines grief and mourning. It hones in on how differently people see the world and why some of us are more pessimistic/optimistic than others. Who are we - bright lights or black holes? How do we cope with knowing that happiness is not guaranteed?The developing relationship was a slow burn. I lived for every knee bump, nose nuzzle, breathy ear whisper, and pretend nonchalant touching of skin and limbs. The sex scenes were intense but poetic, exactly how I like them.Emily Henry's writing was easy to devour but also lyrical. Her primary and secondary characters were all so well written, flawed but evolving. The witty banter was top-notch. There were many things I loved - the perfectly crafted references to books and movies, the notes they held up for each other from one window to the other, the hesitancy to ask questions, intimately getting to know someone you think you already have all figured out then realizing how wrong you were, allowing them to challenge and change your perspective. I laughed. I cried. I was at the edge of my seat. I felt it all on such a deep, human level.I finished this yesterday and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

Subclassing is a great way of putting tons of variation into character creation. Even though there are only technically 12 classes, with each class having at least two subclasses, traditions, circles, orders, domains, colleges, schools, etc. there's closer to 40 options for builds just in the class selection. Top that off with most classes having some form of access to magic and the ability to multiclass easily (no penalties to multiclassing like in 3.x and multiclassing isn't as useless as in 4e), and the classes are entirely solid in this PHB.Races have a similar amount of selection as classes do, with many races having some sort of subrace(s), the exceptions being humans, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings. Dragonborn have subraces in the form of choosing the color of scales and the breath weapon associated with that, but their subrace variant isn't exactly variant in itself.Equipment, feats, etc. is all pretty well detailed. The trinkets table is interesting as well.The book itself is well made. The art is good and abundant with lots of detail put into it.

343,786965606,5,Streamlined,7 people found this helpful,"A short background: I'm not really a tabletop RPG gamer.  Sure, I have a buddy that runs some games (that's why I picked this up), have dabbled in the past with other friends, and I have played BG2, Icewind Dale, and NW and NW2 into the ground, so I know my D&D.  As a dad with a full-time job, I just don't have the time or energy to spend 3-5 hours every week after work dungeon crawling.With that background in place, I find this book to be an absolute breath of fresh air.  This is a great ruleset for someone without the time or ability to really delve into a character, or for a group to quickly set up a crawl on a cold winter weekend.  The rules have been streamlined from my days with 3.5e and Pathfinder (they are a touch simpler, much more efficient, and involve very few negative numbers).  More importantly, the rules put quite a bit more emphasis on roleplaying and acting a part.  That is not to say the depth is gone.  Not even close.  It is absolutely still there for the GM and others if you want it (just look at some of the other reviews and Wizards own running blog to demonstrate that), particularly if you look at the other books and really get into the feats and adventuring sections of the PH.Best example of how this ruleset is different than previous iterations: I can look at my wife and say ""sure love, you can play an elvish barbarian if you want,"" knowing that it will actually be fun for her.  She might still stink compared to a min/max half-orc barbarian, but the rules are much more forgiving of such oddball characters.  They seem to WANT you to try goofy things like that and just play it out!On top of all that, the book has nice art, is well designed, and a good read (if you enjoy rule books).

He mentions the band members at the end, almost as a tribute (which moved my review from a 4- to a 5-star), but I really wanted more insight into the origins of the Foo Fighters.

352,451524934,5,"A look at our future, from our past",One person found this helpful,"When Orwell originally wrote 1984, it was to be called 1948. This was  because he'd figured that by 1948 the world would be split into  ""superstates"", and all a form of some totalitarianism or other.  And a terrifyingly new kind of totalitarianism. One that utilizes  technology to invade the privacy of every one of it's citizens. Orwell gave  us the term ""big brother is watching"". And this is done by  cameras that are placed everywhere. Knowing it to be impossible for someone  to watch you 24 hours a day is small comfort when you never know when  you're being watched.  It bothers me that Orwell is not  considered to be one of the great authors of the 20th century, as he was so  adept at breaking down complex societies, and goverments into contexts that  most everyone can understand. Both in 1984, and Animal Farm.  1984 is the story about an average man who finds more and more that the  life he's leading, and the government he works for is wrong. Horribly  wrong. The society he lives in is sick. In time he discovers, through a  forbidden book, that the decades long war they've been fighting against the  other superstates is actually a fabrication based on the concept that war  can sustain an entire economy, because everything that a society produces  is destroyed. And that stoking the fears and hatreds towards the other  superstates can create a nucleus that a society can form it's self around.  We are versed on double-think, and  double-speak; where one can spout, and believe government rhetoric, all the  while knowing the truth right in front of their face.

364,399587683,4,Infinitely better than The Wedding Date!!,,"4.5 starsWhen I read The Wedding Date, I thought Drew’s best friend Carlos was a great, really funny guy. I was on the fence about reading The Proposal until I saw that it was Carlos’ love story, at which point my interest was up 1000%. Although I had to speed read this book to make sure I finished it before my ebook was returned to the library, I thoroughly enjoyed it; I probably would’ve read it nearly as fast without the time crunch.I loved Nikole and Carlos right away, and had so much fun reading their story. I loved their banter and inside jokes and the generally sweet nature of their relationship. (Now the thought of sour cream makes me giggle. If you know, you know.) I also really liked Nik’s friends, Dana and Courtney, and how they roasted one another so frequently but were still, without fail, each other’s biggest cheerleaders. (And reading about Courtney’s cupcake shop has me craving cupcakes. I don’t have cupcakes. Crap.)In both books I’ve read by Guillory at this point in time, I’ve noticed some conversations with rather cheesy dialogue, though I can overlook that since her books are so much fun to read. What I can’t overlook so easily is the surprising amount of similarities between her protagonists and love interests. Each side character is unique, but the same can’t be said about the stars of the show. Alexa, Drew, and now Nikole and Carlos are all very driven people, hard-working but still very social, that for some reason or another aren’t looking for a serious, long-term relationship. Both The Wedding Date and The Proposal go about like this: two attractive people meet, want sex, have sex, like it enough to continue having sex, catch feels, realize they caught feels, bail on said feels, mope about until their friends encourage them to kiss and make up, then actually kiss and make up, the end.I know romance novels are usually formulaic to some extent and I don’t mind that. Over the last several months, I’ve grown to love them despite the fairly obvious patterns, and find them very comforting to read. However, something about this specific situation, with these specific books, just feels janky to me, and I wanted to mention it.That being said, it didn’t stop me from loving this book or adding the rest of the books in the series to my TBR, and it certainly won’t stop me from recommending this book to others.

382,1984806734,5,Just what I needed right now,,"Thank you to Berkley for gifting me a review copy of Beach Read by Emily Henry.I was only a few chapters in when I knew I was going to love this book. Although how a book that involves researching a murder-suicide cult can possibly be this cute I really don’t know. But it is.I’ve read a lot of romance books lately, from steamy to rom-com, to cry-your-eyes-out-heartbreaking and I was starting to think there were no really new stories in the world. Until Beach Read. It was refreshingly different.January and Gus are both novelists who end up living next door to each other (for reasons I won’t reveal in order to avoid spoilers). They enter into a bet that the other person couldn’t swap genres for their next book. They help each other with different research methods and activities, which naturally end up like bizarre sorts of dates as they both write their next novels.The characters in Beach Read are wonderful, well actually they’re pretty flawed, but they’re wonderfully developed. And while it’s no surprise that they become involved it was beautiful to watch them uncover things about each other and help the other grow and move through their insecurities and past trauma.Plus the book is packed with hilarious details about the writing process. Like when you’re watching a movie and the lead suddenly turns to the camera and speaks to you directly, letting you in on a little secret. They even talk about their favorite reviews, like the guy that left one star on Amazon saying “Did not order Book” or the ones who explain what the author was ‘really’ trying to do. As a reviewer, that had me in stitches.Through their genre-swap Gus and January are researching a cult called New Eden though, and there are a few dark topics and moments touched on, so be aware of that going into it.I love that the author wrote this book, about writer’s block, because she actually had writer’s block. She was itching to write, but no sparks of an idea or story were coming to her, so she started researching and thinking about writer’s block itself…and now here we are!This gets all the stars from me, and the audiobook is wonderful too if you’d like to be read to.

And it doesn't need at all to be flowery, happy ending, saccharine stuff. Quite the contrary.  I honestly dreaded returning to it each day and forced myself to finish it. Animal Farm was far better, with the same elements of writing and reference to political history and fears of the time. And more clever too. But I'm told that Orwell was I'll when he wrote this, which explains the disjointed feel overall.

455,1451673310,5,Bradbury's Fire Forever Lights the Way,One person found this helpful,"For me, Fahrenheit 451 more than deserves its place among the top five on my 'Absolute Best Books Ever' list. How anyone who has actually carefully digested it could possibly give it less than five out of five stars is quite beyond me. But to each his own, I do suppose. And really good books don't always have to satisfy absolutely everyone, to have the lasting effect that this particular one has most certainly had.What more to say? Well, for starters, judging by Fahrenheit 451 alone, Ray Bradbury was nothing short of a literary genius, and it's a truly invaluable thing that he gifted future generations with a yarn so exquisitely told. Full of thought provoking contradictions, like the bizarre dystopian future it depicts, the author's narrative alternates between being complicated and deceptively simplistic in its approach, yet is somehow still equal parts subtle and heavy handed in just the right measure when necessary.For example, the premise itself, that one dark day, in a potentially dark future, firemen will burn books, homes and even people, instead of preserving and protecting them, might seem absurd if Bradbury didn't handle the material with such seemingly effortless brilliance. So much so, that the reader's natural inclination towards disbelief is subordinated to such a profound degree, that before you know it, you're seeing shades of genuine fascism in the Firemen, and in all of the chief antagonist's perverted banter, that turns the concepts of equality and justice upside down and backwards, and may actually leave one wondering how much of what Captain Beatty says is really something to think ever so deeply about.And the implications of the totalitarian future Bradbury presents really is troubling.  Even scary. But that frightful roller coaster of inverted thought patterns and potential future realities is what makes Fahrenheit 451 work so astoundingly well. But is that really the precise temperature at which paper ignites and bursts into flame? How incredibly irrelevant! The real point is that few other works of imaginative fiction have done such a superb job of giving readers so very much to think about while reading so precious few pages.Sure, the book isn't especially long, but does it really have to be? It's true. In pretty short order Bradbury introduces his suddenly shell shocked to true life protagonist, and the ill fated young muse who breathes new life in him. It all seems so mundane at first, but then the author takes us into Montag's home, all through his workplace, and then out and about, into a frighteningly macabre, yet antiseptically stale and deathly whited sepulcher of an urban futurescape, where the meaning of literacy itself is under full scale attack. And once we've seen all that, what more is there really to know, but how is it all going to end?And since Bradbury's cautionary tale is all about burning anything incongruous or even potentially ""antisocial"" in society to indistinct, untraceable ash, all that is left after we've seen how bleak and twisted what has become of the American founding fathers' original quest for equality and the pursuit of happiness, is to take the plunge into the author's masterful ending, that, despite its apocalyptic overtones, actually ends up becoming a whole new beginning for mankind.

462,786965606,5,Exceptional value - great book,,"I am an old school D&D gamer/Dungeon Master who cut his teeth on the 'Red' basic set and then moved into ""Advanced Dungeons and Dragons"" (1st ed.), all the while trying other stuff like Star Frontiers and I.C.E. By the time 2nd edition came out, I had moved on. Just recently, I decided to get back into it and started up a 1st edition campaign. As the new 5th edition material came out, I bought them initially 'out of curiosity' and have now started a 5th edition campaign. I may move exclusively into 5th edition because of the common sense ideas, ease of play, and stunning packaging. Having the basic set of rule for 5th edition available on line for free makes it easy for new players to prepare before committing to buying anything.I love this new 'Players Handbook'. The gaming system itself is pretty streamlined and set up more for 'role-playing' than it is for super accuracy in actions. A new player could pick this book up (or use the online rules) to create a character very quickly and easily. There are quick set-ups for characters (with everything laid out - just plug in your numbers) and quick set-ups for equipment (like explorer packs). I like how some of the rules differ from 1st edition to 5th edition, e.g., how armor class is the number needed to hit, how 1st level characters start with maximum hit points, and how spell points make a low level magic-user much more useful. There are all the old races and classes plus a few new ones too.Old gamers looking to get back in should start here with 5th edition.

We were able to just follow along with what the character was feeling while it was happening. It was also a novel about growing up -not so much coming of age, but about growing and changing as an adult when life throws specific challenges your way. It lets us know it is normal to be optimistic and want to hope for happy endings, but your views can also change in an instant when the stark realities of life hit. The story is a slow journey of healing through complicated grief, that the protagonist isn’t even aware of until it is already happening, followed by a choice to allow this healing to happen. January shows readers that you don’t have to put on a brave face all the time, and often that is more harmful in the long run- sometimes like breaks you, and you’re allowed to fall apart. She demonstrates that you’re allowed to have both good and bad days- it’s not one or the other.

476,1984806734,4,A predictable ending does not spoil the joy of the journey,,"As the Disney folks reminded us in Beauty & the Beast, it's a ""tale as old as time."" But author Emily Henry has put her unique stamp on a classic tale, and made it more than just a romantic romp. Beach Read may have a fluffy title, but there is real substance to Henry's story of two writers who must overcome heartbreak, and set aside their preconceived ideas and assumptions about each other, and life, to forge a relationship.January has come to North Bear Shores, Michigan for the summer. Her previous books -- romantic comedies -- have sold well, but the royalties have stopped flowing in and she's down to just a few dollars in her bank account. Her next book is due at the end of the summer, but she's suffering from a severe case of writer's block that she needs to break through in order to meet her deadline. She's endured a lot in the past year. Her beloved father's sudden, unexpected death was followed by shocking revelations about his life. January learned everything she knew about love and life from her parents. An only child, her parents doted on and supported her. But more importantly, they modeled a loving, committed, demonstrative relationship that she held up as an ideal. Once, when she was a child, they briefly separated, but soon reconciled. To January, it seemed that her family always emerged from troubled times stronger, with more love and laughter than before the dark days. Her father stood by her mother through two successful cancer battles. So January was flabbergasted to learn that her father had an extramarital relationship that spanned years and took place on weekends at his secret lake house. She found out about the affair at his funeral when a strange woman introduced herself as an ""old friend"" of January's father, and presented January with an envelope and a key. January immediately knew why the woman was there, and her suspicions were confirmed when her mother hissed, ""Sonya,"" revealing that her mother had known about her father's relationship. But her mother refuses to discuss the matter. Sonya tells January that her father wanted her to have the beautiful house on Lake Michigan. Now she needs to dispose of her father's personal property, sell the house, and ""write a romance despite having recently lost close to all faith in love and humanity.""January quickly discovers that her next-door neighbor is none other than her college rival, Gus. In the ensuing years, Gus has used his full name -- Augustus Everett -- because he has become a published author of a serious book that remained on the bestseller list for five weeks. But in college, he was known as Sexy, Evil Gus, and January was ""minorly besotted with him and his prose."" January felt Gus didn't take her seriously after she presented him a short story to be critiqued and he told her, ""Let me guess: Everyone lives happily ever after. Again."" At that point, January was not yet a romance writer, but she was writing ""romantically, about a good world, where things happened for a reason, where love and human connection were all that really mattered."" During college the two of them competed for recognition and writing prizes, but barely spoke until one fateful night at a fraternity party . . .January and Gus are reunited in his aunt's local bookstore and their journey to happily-ever-after begins. Gus proposes a bet. He will spend the summer writing a romance, and January will write the kind of ""bleak literary fiction"" that Gus has previously published. They will take each other on field trips designed to illuminate the important components of the type of fiction each will be writing. Gus takes January to the burned-out remains of a cult tucked deep into the forest and she accompanies him when he spends hours interviewing a survivor who was raised there. January takes Gus line dancing, to a drive-in movie, and on other romantic adventures. They agree that ""whoever sells their book first -- with a pen name, if you prefer -- wins."" The loser will have to promote the winner's book by writing an endorsement for the cover, recommending it during interviews, and choosing it when judging for book clubs. Gus throws in another stipulation: ""Promise not to fall in love with me.""The secret to Beach Read's charm is the crisp, snappy, and frequently hilarious conversations between January and Gus as the weeks pass. There is also much they don't say as each struggles to regain confidence in their writing . . . and themselves.Henry credibly examines both January's grief and rage. January feels she can't write another love story because the stories she crafts mean so much to her, and she can't deliver a book to her readers that she doesn't believe in. After all, her whole perspective on life and relationships has been disrupted, rocked to its very foundation by her father's deceit. She was so close to her parents, but also felt pressure not to add to her parents' worries as her mother fought for her life. For years, January was so afraid that her mother would die, she did everything she could to make her parents proud, spending time with them, and publishing her first book at the age of twenty-five. She even fell in love with Jacques, a handsome doctor. Now her father is suddenly gone and she can never ask him all the questions that keep her up at night, never confront him with her frustration about all the years she spent carefully constructing a life free from complications. She has broken off her long-term relationship with Jacques, realizing in the weeks following her father's death when she was depressed and questioning everything she had always assumed to be true, that he could not provide the emotional support she needed. Now she's alone, unable to talk to her mother about her feelings, broke and desperate to fulfill her commitment to her publisher, and living in a house where her father spent time with the woman who was not January's mother.Although January began writing romance novels because she ""wanted to dwell in my happiest moments, in the safe place my parents' love had always been,"" Gus, in contrast, found inspiration in his troubled childhood, ""to try to understand something horrible that had happened to him."" And his writing block has been occasioned by more recent heartbreak that he gradually reveals to January.That the ""will they or won't they"" story takes a predictable path does not detract from the enjoyment of going on the journey with January and Gus. Henry populates the story with an eclectic cast of supporting characters, including Gus's aunt Pete and her wife, Maggie, who are genuine and endearing. January's first-person narrative is emotionally raw -- January lays bare the innermost thoughts, doubts, and feelings that make her empathetic, likable, and authentic. She achieves just the right tone. The characters of January and Gus are fully developed and nuanced, especially as they discuss the art of writing, and their dissimilar approaches to the craft, but ultimately learn how much they have in common. They challenge each other as writers and people, and their egalitarian relationship is a welcome departure from many romantic comedies that depict a weak woman chasing a  strong man. As the relationship between January and Gus blossoms, there is no power disparity.Beach Read is a delightfully fresh retelling of a tried-and-true story. Two enemies challenge and compete with each other and, in the process, learn things about each other that causes them to see each other in a new, appreciative way. That leads to romance and a happy ending. Beach Read lives up to its title in the sense that it is an ideal story in which to get lost on a hot summer day on a beach, by a lake or pool, or in a hammock in one's own back yard.Thanks to NetGalley for an Advance Reader's Copy of the book.",False,romance,1.0,1.0,1.0

484,451524934,4,Be prepared,,The premise of the book is to explore human nature and how as a group they can be manipulated and ruled. The book moves through some obvious manipulations to the grander more subtle perversions of the human mind that would let someone be persuaded to not just be controlled but to think in a suggested way. Of course it is well written but it is not always a clear and concise read. When discussing ideological matters it seams to nite quite clearly explain the way in which the government effects change in people and meanders around the points of why and for whom these changes are affected. The largest inconsistency of which is the eagerness of the general population to forget the past and simply believe the new past the government has devised. As this is part of the point of this book I concede to the point that the reader should not necessarily relate to this group thought process but it could have been better addressed as a construction of the world view.

543,1501128019,3,Enjoyed this couple's love story,31 people found this helpful,"I decided to pick this up audiobook because so many of my fellow readers loved this book hard. I can see why LOVE AND OTHER WORDS connected with so many readers, but I didn't entirely feel the same level of adoration to the story as a whole.Through past/present storytelling, Christina Lauren takes the reader on a journey back to Elliot and Masie's past from when they first met through when they fell in love and later fell apart. Eleven years after their breakup, the two meet again and Elliot is just as in love with her as he was as a teenager. But one problem—Masie is engaged.Christina Lauren almost always writes delicious red-hot chemistry with great banter and dreamy heroes. Those things are present in Love and Other Words. Even though Elliot's character fell into the ""too perfect to feel real"" category, I still swooned hard over his intelligence, nerdiness, and sweetness. Lauren built up their love story as children so well, showing the reader how these two bookworm nerds fell hard for each other over the course of several years. I loved reading their past love story. In a way, we got a what I like to call a ""double love story"" because we got to see them fall in love twice. This book made me feel addicted to it because I kept needing to know what happens next. I love it when that happens!This is Christina Lauren's first foray into women's fiction, so I was curious to see how their writing talents transferred into this new genre for them. My biggest question was how they were going to craft the conflict. In the past, the conflict in some of their stories hasn't been the strongest, which causes the whole story to deflate when it should be exploding.In an attempt to explain away some of the plot contrivances, Lauren asks the reader to believe a lot. Somehow, Elliot didn't know that Masie's dad had passed away. After being best friends for years and deeply in love, Elliot didn't aggressively attempt to reach out to Masie. On the flip side, Masie didn't want to talk over what she saw with Elliot? I don't buy it. If she was that in love to drive hours to see him that night, that same girl would have been pounding at his door and shoving at his chest screaming, ""WHAT THE HELL?!"" Neither Elliot nor Masie ever met their mutual friends in nearly six years of friendship, until the night they broke up. Masie was engaged when she sees Elliot again. But it's a little too convenient that her fiancé is not really that in to her and was totally fine with her ending it.Both characters felt like the same character type we've seen in other Christina Lauren type books. We have the really nerdy sensitive guy and the female professional whose profession didn't really play a part in her character. Though, I did like see Lauren write a story with everyday people, instead of high-powered executives we've seen in the past. With this being billed as women's fiction, I was expecting to see more of an interplay between Masie's profession and her life as well as a more developed emotional arc for Masie's character. Neither of those things really occurred here. To me, this felt like more of a contemporary romance and less like a women's fiction novel. Also, Elliot's life in the present isn't really explored in any detail either. I couldn't even tell you what he does or what he likes (aside from Masie and literature).I really didn't like that we find out that Elliot had been essentially raped, yet this trauma wasn't explored or dealt with in any way whatsoever. Rather, the focus was on the breakup between him and Masie.I did enjoy reading their love story as teens and seeing them reconnect in the future. If you're a die hard women's fiction reader, this book may leave you wanting more. But if you like second chance romance, then I'd recommend you give this one a go (with some reservations), especially to meet the adorable Elliot.",True,romance,1.0,1.0,1.0

She's a toddler but she was clearly upset that her book was in pieces. I jumped on Amazon and found this listing. Some of the reviews were saying how tiny the book is and this was about half the price that was printed on the back of her old copy so I almost didn't order it. Luckily, I took a chance and two days later, Alice had an exact copy of her favorite book. She had just walked over and grabbed her old torn book and was trying to put the pieces together when I opened this package. I laid it on her old book and she smiled real big and ran off with it while I picked up and disposed of the old one. It's a legitimate issue of the book.

It kept me company on my walks as I work my way to 50K.As I said, in the headline, I liked it.  Was it perfect? Maybe not.  There were some things that I found a bit far-fetched procedurally and some of Wise's actions weren't very wise or professional, considering she was a retired FBI agent.  For example, continuing to involve herself after she had been taken off the case and drawing DeMarco in as well.  Continuing to question and bait a suspect she knew was dangerous, rather than backing out and calling for back-up.  Neither are good ideas, but it seems she had a history of that kind of behavior while with the bureau.  It begs the question, ""How did she make it to retirement?""I also found her ""relationship"" with Allen, awkward in the extreme.  Their conversations were painful, but maybe that was the intention.  That kind of unease seems at odds with her very adept ability to interview and interrogate suspects.Overall, I liked Book 1 and will definitely consider more.",False,mystery,1.0,1.0,1.0

He was sick with tuberculosis that killed him shortly after he finished the book.Although some of the depiction of how a totalitarian society crushes individuality and deviations in thought are extreme and grew out of the modus operandi of the Soviet Union as they might have been applied to post-WWII England, some of his insights are scarily relevant to 2017, especially the rise of two-way communication devices that both deliver propaganda and eavesdrop on people, the benefits to the State of being in a perpetual state of war, and the use of ""newspeak"" to have the very structure of language force people to accept lies as truth.  Reminiscent of current use of the Big Lie(s) to diminish people's sense that there is such a thing as reality... one of the main character's final tests is accepting and fully believing that 2 + 2 = 5.His literary craft and style remains engaging 70 years after publication.

30,399587683,4,Fun contemporary (diverse) romance,,"Note: an eARC of this title was acquired via NetGalley.Y'ALL.Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely adored The Proposal. Jasmine Guillory is a fantastic writer, full-stop, and her sophomore novel was a fun contemporary romance that treated its characters (and readers) like competent adults. There was dramatic tension, but it didn't feel like the characters made stupid, dumb choices JUST to move the plot forward. They communicated with one another the way people do in real life and disagreements happened because of what each character SAID to one another, not because they didn't talk to begin with. (Such gasp. Much shock. So horror.)Both the two leads and everyone else were diverse in some way, but no one's backstory or motivations felt contrived or there to only serve a narrative purpose. Like, this novel was just so refreshing and makes you question the romance genre as a whole. Why can't other novels have functioning adults as their protagonists? Why can't there be more than just straight white people falling in love?? Why can't more intersectional stories cross over into the mainstream???I was definitely aware of Guillory's debut, The Wedding Date, earlier this year (an #OwnVoices contemporary romance raved by Roxane Gay!), so I really wanted to read The Proposal as soon as it was published. (Because duh that cover and that summary.) AND LET ME TELL YOU. It delivered. The Proposal could have been any other romance, but because Guillory is so precise in her characterizations, it made sense that THESE characters in THIS setting had THESE things happen to them. The sex scenes weren't gratuitous but they didn't feel safe for work, either. And I know the timeline in which her protagonists fall in love is, in theory, very short, but it's also like why is this taking so long?? ??HUR??RY??UP??Honestly, the only thing that I disliked was that the damn book ended. I could see that the pages left were getting smaller and smaller, but I was also like no??? maybe don't?? And then when Nik and Carlos FINALLY get their Happily Ever After, I turned the page and there was a biography of Guillory instead of more story. (How dare she.)I know that both The Wedding Date and next summer's The Wedding Party take place in the same universe, but that's kind of not the same thing and I am very, very sad I can no longer read this book for the first time.",False,romance,0.0,0.0,0.0

60,1451673310,5,A demonstration of a vanishing art,One person found this helpful,"Fahrenheit 451 should probably be required reading in a few different venues. First, despite its origins in the 1950s, it is remarkably prescient of the effect of technology on literacy; after reading F451, you'll think twice about the next person you see plugged too deeply into facebook on their smart phone. Second, this story should be required reading for the average fiction self-publisher making use of Amazon's Kindle store to hawk their wares. I think F451 exemplifies a style of lyrical, poetic writing combined with a succinct, poignant plot that is disappearing out of the English language in favor of meandering, violent, pointless garbage. The mastery of language in this story should cause every self-publisher to look closely at their own work and to think twice about jumping the gun to hit the 'publish' button. It seems to me that many don't have the sense to know they're not done writing yet. Thirdly, and finally, this story should be required reading for the modern casual fiction reader; again, to see how writing has changed in the last sixty years and also to place an education in the audience sufficient to know what the art of polished writing actually looks like. A reader thus equipped will give self-publishers the correct reviews necessary to make the sorry pseudocreators polluting the field think twice about besmirching the English language. If there is no publisher to step in and stop crap at the source, the audience must be well enough read to be discriminating in the publisher's place.It is freedom of speech for everyone to be allowed to speak their mind, but it is also necessary for future creators to have the education and self-control to muzzle themselves when they have nothing to say --especially if there's no discriminating publisher to step in and stop them when they need stopping. Not every drabble should be sold. Everybody is allowed to speak, but people should understand that those speaking do not always have anything to say. Whoever you are as a writer, aspire to match a master like Bradbury. Whoever you are as a reader, expect what you read to be produced by a master like Bradbury.",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0
61,B01IW9TM5O,5,South Africa from the Coloured Experience,11 people found this helpful,"This book was VERY hard for me to put down!  Knowing a great deal about the apartheid era, it was most interesting to see this moral outrage from the perspective of a ""coloured"" person (i.e. born of mixed blood).  The coloured were badly discriminated by both the whites and blacks; Trevor in a most sensitive and informing manner gave the perspective of social rejection.  Many believe that had the ""coloured"" been treated as ""honorary whites"" apartheid could have lasted much longer.  The genius of apartheid was that it leveraged on race and tribe against the other.  Zulu against Xhosa is a good example.  Indians were also victims of apartheid although much better off than blacks.  I find it amazing that apartheid almost inspired cruel burlesques upon the system.  Example, Chinese were considered ""black"" because the system couldn't really define them but Japanese were ""honorary whites"" and treated accordingly; maybe the construction of a Toyota plant in Port Elizabeth raised the status of wealthy Japanese businessmen.  Now that apartheid has been swept away, the next big challenge for South Africa is tribalism which is the bane of Africa.Trevor gives a good lesson we in America could find as a cautionary tale.  I find that Democrats and Republicans even are becoming ""tribal"" to some extent; i.e. lack  of civility.  Racial resentment between Latino and Blacks is evident in major cities where like South Africa the resentment was fueled by poverty and a lack of middle class jobs.  I am a older white American and instead of wasting this story with a person my own age I intend to give my copy to my 19 year old nephew.

69,786965606,3,Not an OSR System,7 people found this helpful,"Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition was meant as an apology for the blasphemy of 4th Edition. WoTC promised they were going back to the roots of the series in order to bring back fans of all previous editions including AD&D, which encapsulated  D&D before 3rd edition. Despite covering a lot of distance from 4e, they haven't traveled close enough for their promise to have been held. Instead, it feels like a hybrid between 3rd and 4th edition which can't shake its video game inspired roots. A number of mechanics prevent 5th edition from recapturing the spirit, intent, and art of roleplaying of the AD&D systems.There is No Weight to Death :Characters have far too many stop-gaps saving them from death for it to have any real importance. First, they don't die at zero hitpoints; They are knocked unconscious. Then, they must fail 3 unmodified saving throws by rolling 1-9 on a D20 each round until 3 success or 3 failures are rolled. which works out to approximately 36.5% chance to fail 3 with a 63.5% chance to succeed(not factoring critical effects). All it takes to prevent those rolls is 1 round of assistance from someone to stabilize the character. If the rolls result in 3 successes, the character automatically stabilizes.If a character does die, resurrection is common enough that it could be used with no penalty other than a medium cost. There are no permanent penalties, such as constitution loss, which means characters can be resurrected with impunity. Most of the time, one need not worry about getting to this point anyway, as it is truly trivial to keep characters away from death's door.The problem with 5th edition's death mechanic is the absence of genuine tension or punishment. At most, characters can view the fabled death effect as if it were a mere inconvenience; it leads to players having a constant set of training wheels allowing reckless behavior with few opportunities to lose. As established, there is essentially an entitlement afforded to players which disallows them a wide range of potential emotional investment and rich, immersive tension.Monster Abilities are Luke  Warm at Best:Monster abilities in 5e have no lasting consequence. Permanent effects are completely removed. Most dangerous abilities which could kill a player must overcome a statistical lottery of dice rolling, and many intelligent or legendary monsters have had their attack routines codified to the point of yawn worthy predictability. Dragons, for example, now do ""Kewl Pow3rs"" like summoning magma from the ground every 2 rounds. There isn't anything close to the rich,creative and free form abilities as exist in the 2nd edition Monster Manual, nor are any of the monsters worthy of fear; there no level drains, permanent stone effects, long duration charms or Save or Die effects to really make players invested into the scene.The problem with monster design in 5e  is the considerable adherence  to recreating MMO style encounters rather than believable fantasy encounters. At best, the players could be set back, but at worst, the players can easily memorize the single minded strategy of each monster. The only counter to this would be an incredibly skilled and motivated DM who takes the initiative to rework them in ways which result in true challenge not dependent upon numeric advantage. For those who are learning the art of DMing or just playing straight by the book, players have little to fear nor should they expect many surprises.Cantrips Make Magic Average:Cantrips are the magical version of a sword swing. They have no use limit, no cost, and require no other investment to use, yet they do everything from telekinesis to area of effect damage. While they are not as powerful as traditional spells, they can fulfill the same creative utility sans the cost or trade off of casting a full spell. Limitless magic like this drastically reduces the awe of magic and pushes it into the mire of mundane occurrences. Rather than require spellusers to ration their magic and plan accordingly, they got an infinite reservoir of useful abilities to fallback on whenever they need them. There isn't a way to overstate how significant of a blow this is to the traditional gritty feel and believable limitations of Ad&d's rich strategic layer.The Unique Snowflake Syndrome:Despite having the opportunity to move away from D&D 3rd and 4th edition class and race bloat, WoTC make it a central element.They have no fewer than 5 melee classes and more ways to say: ""I'm a magic user"" than one could shake a stick at. Each of them have a different set of abilities which are segregated into paths called ""Archetypes"" which reflect subclass customization. Want to be a Fighter who casts magic, or a Fighter who Commands?; the number of choices varies with each class.Some may argue that variety is good, but when you factor in player psychology, you realize it slows things down and destroys balance. Players get choice paralysis very easily; it is especially true for new players. So many options discourages players from making new characters as it is a dauntingly involved process. While it's not as bad as other editions, it's significantly more involved than AD&D. One can see why character death is so rare by envisioning what it would be like to have to make a new character every session. You have to choose among backgrounds, where to place stat rolls, archetypes, ""choose one of:"" type options etc. Some of these will need to be made each time a character levels up like feats and stat increases which scale with level. All of these distract from the in game role playing and emphasize meta gaming on a level squarely reminiscent, though much reduced , of 3rd edition, 4th edition and the video game mentality in general.Balance is inherently reduced using this approach because of considerable niche overlap. There are only so many ways to hit an enemy with a melee weapon so why have so many classes which do just that? It merely makes classes have to compete with each other to share the same role. Having simple classes which focus on different elements of the games prevents contact friction and enhances individuality through roleplay instead of through character generation.Roll Play:If official adventures from WoTC are any indication of how D&D 5th edition was meant to be played, it's clear that player involvement is relegated to mere die rolling. The existence of passive perception and other passive saves means that characters can automatically detect much of their environment with little to no choice or thought on the players part. If a trap isn't automatically discovered passively, the DM is advised to give the player an active perception check to find it. Should he fail that, he then gets another save to avoid the effects of the trap. On a bad day, this would subject the average character to no more than a 25% chance to ever fall victim to a trap.  What is the point to a player if his character could literally autopilot to victory 75% of the time? Now, of course no two traps are the same; nothing prevents a DM from making deadlier traps either, but WoTC's official publications and blatant autopilot save system clearly indicates such an approach is not the default method. Unfortunately, this removes the player from the equation and makes him little more than a die rolling machine.  WoTC is clearly lowering the bar so as to cater to the largest possible crowd - something which is most certainly not in accordance with the demand of player skill existing in Ad&d and the OSR genre in general.Emphasis on die rolling also contributes to odd and illogical inconsistencies. At one point in an official adventure known as Phandelver, a significant plot point is obfuscated from view unless the players actively make a perception roll. If they fail, they don't find a key plot pathway. If WoTC wanted that to be a fun event, it would be best to let the players search for it themselves, or, if it were so integral to the story line, simply have the DM inform them to begin with and move on to far less petty activities. While not a part of the system itself, it's clear that the system was designed to be applied in this manner. After all, if the developers are playing wrong, who isn't?Combats are Still Slow:Yes, they have reduced the number of modifiers and reigned in on much of the conditional bloat of 4th edition, but they retained a number of features from both 3rd edition and 4th edition which, when combined with new mechanics such as advantage, result in an excessive amount of die rolling. Advantage/Disadvantage aimed to reduce the number of modifiers; it did this at the expense of introducing more die rolls and reducing the granularity of effects and situations which should have nuanced influence. Decision paralysis still exists because each class has multiple abilities to decide on at the start of any round, and most classes get a considerable number of die rolls due to number of attacks and other special abilities. Coupled with the watered down monster abilities, 5th edition combat still feels like a cross between 3rd and 4th edition without any real resemblance to Ad&d, whose combat is both simpler and more tactically rewarding without advantage and disadvantage's blunt countering.Politics has no Place in a Medieval Fantasy RPG:Keep politics out of it. It's not the place to subliminally advertise inclusivity, nor is it the place to make so much noise about gender roles or gender neutral assignments especially when such inclusions reflect such a small (<4%) potential pool of customers. WoTC may as well do the same for everyone who suffers asthma and thus can't match the athleticism of their characters, or  is less tall than the smallest printed human size so as to not make them feel degraded. Leave the slippery slopes to real life. Show relevance through design of a game system people want to play. It's not important to know an author's  political stance.Conclusion:Dungeon & Dragons 5th edition isn't  a bad system. There is nothing which makes it unfun, nor is there anything which bogs it down into neigh un-playability like high level Pathfinder and 4e, but the feel is not genuinely representative of pre-3rd edition D&D. If it weren't for WoTC advertising it as an OSR inspired and directed product, then no harm would have been done; Unfortunately, they did. In doing so, they made what feels to be a blatantly subliminal attempt at redefining the meaning of OSR through their considerable market influence so as to win over a share of the crowd; all  without actually making any sacrifice of their new found fan base. The result is a system which attempts to be a jack of all trades with a sizable fraction of its energy devoted towards the newer school of  thought. This approach leads to jarring inconsistencies regarding the theme of believable fantasy. It often times has a very hard time shaking off its clearly video game inspired mechanical assumptions.For people who want a rich experience which embodies all flavors of RPGs, I recommend them to get the 2nd Edition Dungeons & Dragons system. There you will find D&D as it was envisioned. 5th edition is not a good place to learn about what D&D is all about because it simply does not embody what the creator of the entire series wanted people to experience. With 5th edition, you will only get a certain type of experience which is heavily focused on game mechanics and significantly less focused on role playing. If you want to learn the art of Role Playing, go with 2nd edition. If you want to simply play a fun game, this will do.",True,humor_entertainment,0.0,0.0,0.0

I felt jealousy with Macy, I felt longing with Elliot, I felt the feeling Macy described when she knew she was in love, I felt the betrayal when she saw **SPOILERS** Elliot with Emma. I understood why she disappeared. I would have not only blamed Elliot but myself for the death of my father if it happened that way too. I would have been drowned in regret, guilt and sorrow to ever even bother breathing again. When I found that out I finally understood Macy on a cellular level.

It's quite interesting to read about his upbringing and some of the key moments that happened since becoming a celebrity (Like meeting Quincy Jones). Will is a very likable guy, but at times in the book he is so transparent that he comes off as not a very good person. Other reviewers have mentioned his bragging.

157,B01IW9TM5O,5,Beautiful ??,3 people found this helpful,"Let me tell you something, I love Trevor Noah. Big fan of The Daily Show, stand-up specials on Netflix, and his way of thinking. This guy is just naturally hilarious and apparently, he is also a relevant author. “Born A Crime” is everything I thought it would be, with just a little extra something. Funny story, I tried all of 2018 trying to get a hard copy of Trevor’s novel, but it was either sold out or too expensive, until I finally got it for a fair price and new!Anyways, in his memoir, Trevor introduces his lifestyle in South Africa and how his mother taught his to me the man he is today. Noah talks about the struggles that apartheid injected to his life as a child, and how his mother persevered in a world that kept throwing obstacles at her. Not only did I learn about his childhood and adolescent life, but about his father and the domestic violence his mother endured with Trevor’s step-father.??Trevor Noah’s story is just difficult to digest. Yes, the comedy that is present is entertaining and you’re laughing most of the time while reading, but there’s parts I was just in shock. If I though I was poor growing up in a 2 bedroom apartment, it doesn’t compare to where Trevor was. By any means, he literally made me appreciate the life I thought was not that great. As a child, you don’t really know the problems parents go through, yet is the happiest time of your life.Last night when I was finishing “Born A Crime”, I was tearing up, because his story is so powerful and raw. There’s no filter and it made me realize that Trevor is where he is now because of two things; he got a job that he loves and he listened to his mother’s advice. ??",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

I loved the relationships between the characters, and how the stereotype of ""greasers"" and ""socs"" was broken; they were all just people. I especially loved the relationship between Ponyboy and his brothers. I don't have any brothers, but reading this book made me want one (or two) older brothers to look out for me like Soda and Darry did for Ponyboy.

163,1501128019,5,The Meaningfulness of Words,,"I’m a lover and a teacher of words, so I definitely understand the power they can wield. Words can both harm and heal…both uplift and destroy. Their effect on people is based on the decisions of the speaker and the reactions of the listener, and as Joyce Meyer explains, ‘words are containers for power, you choose what kind of power they carry.’As childhood friends, Macy Sorensen and Elliot Petropoulos bonded through their love of words and all that came with them, and the more time they spent together, the easier it became to transition from friends to lovers, but as the saying goes, ‘sometimes love just isn’t enough,’ and for reasons, unbeknownst to readers, their love and bond couldn’t last, so when we first meet Macy and fate puts Elliot in her path, the boy she hasn’t seen for more than a decade, all we can do is trust in the words that Christina Lauren use to tell Macy and Elliot’s story because it’s more than apparent from that singular moment in time that their journey together never completely ended, and that’s exactly what the writers give readers, and as we travel back to the whys and hows of Macy and Elliot forming a friendship and then a romantic relationship, we constantly question what went wrong…what could have possibly happened to create a divide that left two people so in love from speaking to one another for over 10 years, and then as readers come back to Macy and Elliot’s present and witness their reactions to one another and how easily the memories of their time together plays out in their minds, the need to understand what happened and push for them to fix it overpowers us, and while readers’ patience will definitely be tested, when the details do come out and the extent of what occurred is revealed, it’s difficult to truly know how Macy and Elliot move forward, knowing that the past unequivocally brought them to their knees.Love and Other Words is an emotional journey told completely through Macy’s POV, and while Elliot’s perspective probably could have shed light on why Macy has spent the last decade crafting a carefully constructed and ordinary life, I feel like it has to be Macy’s story to tell because that’s the only way she’ll be able to heal and perhaps feel like she’s ready to shake up her routine and uneventful life.Christina Lauren is such a dynamic duo of storytellers; all of the words they choose to create their stories allow readers to transport themselves to the setting of the book and to place themselves in the minds of the main characters, and even though some readers might find it a bit confusing to switch between then and now when it comes to Macy and Elliot’s story, Christina Lauren uses seamless transitions so that it’s clear why the scenes from the past are next to the scenes from the present, and for a story like Love and Other Words, it is paramount that Macy and Elliot’s history be shared because without it, readers wouldn’t understand why their present turned out the way it did or why they have to fight against their past in order to give themselves a real shot at a future.4.5 Poison Apples",False,romance,1.0,1.0,1.0

In the first story, he was the no BS tell it like it is for Drew that everyone should have. In his own story, though, he seemed far less mature and rational, especially with how he handled things with Nik.At one point his irrational, out of left field behavior made me actually yell out, ""WHAT? Are you kidding me? Who does that?"" Yeah, he irritated me here and I was so disappointed with this book.Nik was okay, but she didn't leave too much of an impression on me.

January Andrews moves into a beach house she inherited from her father, only to find out that her college rival Augustus Everett lives next door.  January writes romances and Augustus is known for literary fiction.  They get off on the wrong foot (of course)... attempt to avoid each other, and then eventually concoct a bet to get out of their respective writing ruts. January has to write something literary and August is supposed to write something romantic.  But throughout the course of the summer, they learn so much about each other and from each other as they write books outside of their comfort zone. Emily Henry does a wonderful job of re-inventing the enemies-turned-lovers trope.  January and Gus are great characters with wonderful development and depth. The story behind the romance was heartfelt as well.

In the new book, the author Alice Schertle's  great rhymes are back and the illustrations by Jill McElmurry are cute and fun once again.When I pre-ordered my copy of the book, there wasn't a product description, so I was happily surprised when I discovered it has flaps which you lift to see what is underneath.  The concept is that each of our favorite animals are in the book once again and most are in costume.  You lift the flap to see which animal is “hidden” under their mask.  I really appreciate that it helps re-enforce animal names while a child has fun with guessing and enjoying the cute costumes.  The back page is an entire flip-over page and reveals the biggest costumed entity as well.  Don't want to ruin the big surprise but don't be surprised is there are a few “Beep, beep, beeps” to be read.I purchased one copy thinking it would be enough for both of my grandchildren but, as it turns out, my grandson likes it so well, he wants it kept by the rocking chair in his room at my house.

213,670062510,5,The Ouroboros of YA literature,,"Rereading this classic was a joy. No need to summarize the plot or describe the characters, since most of you reading this likely know a good deal about both, whether you have already read this novel or not. The Outsiders is one of the first—if not *the* first—Young Adult novel to take adolescents seriously, as complex human beings with inner conflicts and genuinely profound dilemmas that truly matter.Yes, it has some drawbacks. Although it was written by a woman, it features just two female characters, only one of whom matters to the plot, albeit in a very limited manner. It contains no racial or ethnic diversity, so it loses points in terms of representation. The novel does, however, foreground issues of social class and economic inequality—matters that make rare appearances in contemporary YA texts, let alone any texts in 1967, when it was originally published.It is foundational. And if you might think the text is somewhat simple and unsophisticated, just take a look at its final sentences, which are also its opening sentences. Bet you never knew that The Outsiders was also one of the first metafictional YA texts, did ya?",True,children,1.0,1.0,1.0

220,670062510,5,I don't understand why people think this book is violent,6 people found this helpful,"I read this book 2 times and is currently reading again not because it's for school, but also because I'm really enjoying the book. I don't get what is violent about this book and I think the person who rated this book as ""Horrible and Violent book"" does not really understand the book.1. The reason why the story tells a boy(Johnny) getting abused by his father is to tell the readers that Johhny would never know what the love and affection are without his buddies.2. The boy(Ponyboy) was getting drowned by the ""Socs(Socials)"" because Ponyboy and Johnny was a ""Greaser(Hoods)"" meaning they were like Criminals(junivile delinquents) and that's how people look at Greasers, while people like Socs because they have clean hair wearing madras shirts and riding corvairs and stuff.3. Ponyboy mentioned ""Electric chair"" because an incident happened and he was terrified that they'll get a bigger consequences than Socs because they're Greasers. Johnny killed a Soc with a switchblade because Ponyboy was getting drowned by a Soc and Bob(one of the Socs) scared Johnny to kill him. Johnny also killed Bob because he's the one who nearly beat him to death and left him at the lot(flashback).4. Johnny and Ponyboy hurried and left the scene, and went to find Dally(one of their buddies). He was in a party and when Dally told them that he was sleeping in a bed, he also mentioned that he was actually(literally) sleeping, doing nothing else.5. Sodapop(Ponyboy's older brother) had a girlfriend named Sandy, and he wanted to marry her but she left him because he was a Greaser and didn't even graduate highschool. Not because she was pregnant. Sodapop really liked her but she didn't realize that his feelings were true.6. A girl named Cherry was also a Soc, and got in the car with other Socs not guys. She got in a car because one of them was her boyfriend and she couldn't stand fights(The Socs called Greasers in a mean way and Ponyboy's buddy Two-Bit held his switchblade and gave Ponyboy a busted glass bottle). You also can realize that even though Cherry is a Soc, she isn't mean to Greasers like other Socs.7. When Ponyboy and Johnny met Dally and told him what happened, he told them there was a old Church at Windrixvile and that they can stay there while things are settled up. The church one day caught on fire and Ponyboy and Johnny tried to save the kids. Ponyboy was able to get out of the burning church but Johnny passed out before he got out of the church.Ponyboy was fine, One of Dally's arm got little burned but he was okay, Johnny's back was broken and he had a bad burn and eventually died.8. When Dally heard that Johnny died, he couldn't take it because he loved Johnny so much(like a brother) and broke in a store and got shot by the cops because that's what he wanted.9. Also Johnny once said to Ponyboy that he wants to kill himself but while he was in a hospital dying, he told Ponyboy that he doesn't want to die anymore. Johnny thought dying at age of 16 is not enough and wanted to learn more things in his life.It's an awesome book if you know the meanings of the popular quotes such as ""Stay gold ponyboy, stay gold"" meaning good things also has an end to it(I think) and it's also helpful to review the poem ""Nothing gold can stay"" by Robert Frost.",True,children,1.0,1.0,1.0

The core rules are elegantly simple, while the classes, races and spells are full of interesting options and details for the players without being overly complex. The system also has a spell or ability that covers everything a fantasy character SHOULD be able to do, without making any of those options overpowered (for example, the wizards has the full of variety of spells and spell effects you would expect from 2nd/3rd edition, you just can't do it all at the same time and no effect is overpoweringly effective).  There's also a profound respect for including mechanics that cater to different playstyles, from rules for character-oriented roleplaying to a feat that gives all classes access to rules evoking 4th edition's tactical combat.  I won't say it's flawless--some may wish the core mechanics had a few more options, and the shallower curve of the stats, while a good thing, mayhave issues--but this is by far the smoothest running version of DnD I've played (and I've played 2nd through 5th).",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

276,1501128019,5,Five Beautiful Stars!!!,One person found this helpful,"I’ve been reading Christina Lauren for years. I’ve always enjoyed their writing but over the last year I’ve been consuming their stories. Their last three books have sucked me in from the very beginning. Their stories are so complex and layered. They leave me hanging on every word and bring out so many emotions in me. Love and Other Words is a second chance romance but it’s more than that, Its coming home. Its reconnecting with your soul and finally feeling complete. Elliot and Macy meet when they’re just barely entering their teen years. They bond over books and just connect on a deep level. They’re best friends, then lovers, then strangers. This story focuses on their early years and their reconnection after more than a decade. This is a beautiful story of first love, friendship, forgiveness and soul mates. I wish I could give this more than five stars!",True,romance,1.0,1.0,1.0
277,1484707230,5,"Really good book, teaches you some greek mythology, and offers you great entertainment.",One person found this helpful,"This review is by my 9-year-old son Anay.One reason why Percy Jackson is a really good book is that there are Greek gods and monsters. For example, in book 1 Percy meets Zeus, in book 3 he meets Dionysus, and in book 5 he meets the whole counsel. I think Greek gods are cool because they are powerful allies but make deadly enemies. For example, when Apollo and Artemis’s mother Leto was ambushed by a giant, she called them and they arrived and killed the giant. This shows how powerful and interesting the Greek gods are. Because there are Greek gods and monsters, you can even learn some Greek mythology which might come in handy in a history test. So Percy Jackson is sort of realistic fiction. Moving on, another reason why Percy Jackson is a really good book is that Percy has cool powers and stays in a cool camp. For example, Percy can control water, the camp has a cool armory and arena, and because he can speak to fish and horses. Percy is able to speak to Pegasus because Pegasus is part horse so he can ask Pegasus for help. Although Percy Jackson is a really good book because of Greek mythology and his powers and home, I think the most important reason is that he goes on an interesting quest in every book. For example, in book 1, Percy goes on a quest for the lightning bolt, in book 2 he finds the golden fleece, and in book 3 Percy finds the “beast” that can destroy the Olympians. The quests are really cool because a lot of adventure happens in them. All in all, I hope that I have convinced you that Percy Jackson is a really good book because Percy has cool powers and home, there are Greek gods, and most of all because Percy goes on an interesting quest in every book.",True,children,1.0,1.0,1.0

335,786965606,5,Great Introduction to a Great Game!,5 people found this helpful,"As a brand new D&D player, this book was amazing!A friend finally, after YEARS, pestered me into joining her in entering this world of D&D, and after the first two meetings I had with her I HAD to buy this book. Even before making it to an actual game session, I had so much fun reading through all the different classes and characters, and had an absolute blast making my own. I ended up making... twelve(?) characters, just for fun. The rules and descriptions are written out pretty well, and I've never had any problems reading it. However, my friend's relatives, who played in 2 and 3e, hate it, because ""its so different"" and are having issues adjusting to new rules. Rules that I have read and seem very concise to me make no sense to them, so be warned about switching to 5e if you're a vet player.Now while I LOVE this book and this game, I'm going to talk about its flaws more than anything else, just to give warning to issues I faced, since there isn't much more I can say on the positive side. It was great... now what?My main issue is that there is a lot of... fluff for lack of a better word. Its not that the book is drawn out, but throughout the first several chapters they start explaining certain things (like dice checks, equipment, magic) but then the book just tells you ABOUT the thing and not the rules, how it applies, when to use it, ect, and instead directs you to another chapter in the book that doesn't actually explain that extensively. I'm still having a very hard time understanding saving throws and the difference between a saving through and a dice check, which isn't helped by the relatives telling me things from old versions that isn't ANYWHERE in the book. Conversely, it spends a lot of time explaining what the character is doing, rather than how to do it over the course of the rolls. When explaining ability checks, for example, it goes over EVERY SINGLE ability check in the terms of what the character is doing, rather then telling me what to roll, what modifiers to add, and what I am rolling against. Obviously a charisma check is for talking to people and strength is for physical endeavors. How about telling me how these apply to my actual rolls rather than telling me what my character is doing?Also, all the spells are collected in one giant mess in the BACK of the book. Chapter 10 is all the rules of magic (which falls prey to the same issue I had above), but chapter 11 is nothing but a LONG list of spells. The first several pages of this chapter break down into a list the names of the spells that each class can get and what the levels of the spells are. Then it goes into a very detailed list talking about each individual spell in alphabetical order, regardless of class functions as many of the spells overlap. While not the end of the world, flipping back and forth from the class description and abilities to the class spell list to the actual spell is a bit frustrating. Keep that in mind, when gaining new spells, there are THREE locations you need to keep on tab. I suggest buying a pack of index cards and writing down the entire spell details on one for when you are actually playing. Having to try and find the spell you're looking for while fighting SUCKS.All that aside, I strongly recommend grabbing this book, for new players and old! If you're going to be playing with a group, go ahead and snatch up your own copy. We tried to manage a five player and one DM group on one handbook... that was a massive mistake. We now have three and I still dread leveling up or starting new campaigns because it takes FOREVER to go through and update/make characters when sharing books. The book is honestly fun to read, even without the premise of actually playing. Come, join us in the world of D&D!",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

341,451524934,5,1984 a 21st Century Novel,3 people found this helpful,"George Orwell's last book - 1984 was published in 1949 for the first time. It has since been reprinted in 1961, 1977, 1981 and 2003.Many reviews have been written. I do not presume to have anything new to say about the book.  As the author of the foreword of the Centennial Edition, Thomas Pynchon, observed ""It is not difficult to guess that Orwell, in 1984, was imagining a future for his son's generation, a world he was not so much wishing upon them as warning against. He was impatient with predictions of the inevitable, he remained confident in the ability of ordinary people to change anything, if they would."" It seems to be a thread woven through the book...""that human decency, like parental love, can always be taken for granted - a faith so honorable that we can almost imagine Orwell, and perhaps even ourselves, for a moment anyway, swearing to do whatever must be done to keep it from ever being betrayed.""  In his Afterword, Eric Fromm offers this observation. ""Orwell. . .is implying that the new form of managerial industrialism, in which man builds machines which act like men and develops men who act like machines, is conducive to an era of dehumanization and complete alienation, in which men are transformed into things and become appendices to the process and production and consumption...Orwell...is not a prophet of disaster. He wants to warn and awaken us....the danger with which all men are confronted today, the danger of a society of automatons who will have lost every trace of individuality, of love, of critical thought, and yet who will not be aware of it because of 'doublethink.'""Fromm continues ""Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings. and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.""As in all timeless creative writing Orwell has given us, the reader, many lessons. He has raised the alarm - it is up to us - 21st century humans - to heed it.",True,humor_entertainment,0.0,0.0,0.0

I didn't have the cool clothes or fancy sneakers, nor did I care for sports.Reading was an escape for me. I longed to see the world, and books let me do just that. ""The Outsiders,"" though not based on a great place to grow up, led me on an adventure in which I discovered there were others from different walks of life that felt like an outsider too.In my 11th grade Honors English class, my teacher was horrified when she saw me re-reading ""The Outsiders."" She told me that Hinton's books were ""trash,"" and she didn't understand why I would waste my time reading them. I loved this teacher and valued her opinions and critiques; however I told her that I loved these books, I identified with many of Hinton's characters, and I would read these books over and over.Simply put, I believe most people - at some point in their lives - feel ""less than"" their peers.

364,1984806734,5,4.5 stars,,"Beach Read by Emily Henry has received a lot of hype, so I was happy that it lived up to my expectations and did not disappoint. First of all, I loved the unique premise. I can't think of many romances featuring two authors. I loved both characters, Gus and January, and their chemistry was off the charts. Gus is all dark and brooding, and January is the total opposite. Gus calls January fairy princess because she writes romance and gives all her characters a happy ending, while he writes depressing literary fiction. They are complete opposites but they bring the best in each other.The book has two of my favorite tropes: second-chance and nemeses-to-lovers. And although Beach Read has a lot of funny moments, it also has some somber and more profound themes of loss, grief, and child abuse. This book satisfied a lot of my cravings. It was funny, angsty, emotional, and clever. I thought the ending was a little rushed, but maybe it was because I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters.

385,B0176M3U10,5,ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL BOOKS OF 2016,5 people found this helpful,"HOLY WOW! It Ends With Us is one of the most powerful books of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I’ve ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It’s a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever been prouder of a heroine. I’ve loved Colleen Hoover’s books for a long time because she always writes unique stories… and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completely spoiler-free review. I’m not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It’s a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it’s amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I’m the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I’ve really learned to trust Colleen’s writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all… and I was blown away by the story!This book is unputdownable. You’ll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I didn’t finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I’ve ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn’t be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I’d want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don’t think I’ve been this proud of a fictional character before.There’s an incredibly powerful message in this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don’t yet realize how significant each of these moments truly are… and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I’m not mentioning it on purpose because I don’t want you to expect it. The fact that it’s unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it’s also unexpected for the heroine. As she begins to realize what kind of situation she’s in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journey with her.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the ‘love triangle’ because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don’t want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you’re thinking this book is, just trust me — it’s so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I’m always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time — not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant — and there’s this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such a strong impact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went ‘woah!’. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn’t possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make a seriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people — whether they’ve personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has — so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don’t want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time.

416,1984806734,4,A well-balanced summer read,,"A solid 4 stars for Beach Read by Emily Henry. I learned about this book from Book of the Month but snagged a paperback copy during Target's ""Buy 2; Get 1"" sale this summer.The story is about two writers, January, who writes romance novels that are happily ever afters and Augustus, who is committed to dark literary fiction. The two genres and writers are as different as their seasonal names suggest (i.e., summer/winter). They have a history with one another dating back to their college days and consider each other literary rivals. Both writers are also at difficult points in their personal lives, suffering from writer's block in their professional ones, and just happen to be living in adjacent beach houses. Their professional troubles lead them to make a bet of sorts, January will write a literary fiction as her next novel and Augustus will write a romantic one for his. This agreement takes them on several adventures togethers, and as you might suspect, a friendship develops.By the cover, you might think this book is chick lit or a rom-com, and that would be true, there are some steamy scenes. However, the plot much deeper than romance. The personal issues the protagonists are struggling with are very real and somewhat dark. I picked up this book thinking I would get a light read, but I got more than I bargained for and I think it made for a successful story. A reader might be looking for a light, thoughtless read to push through the hot summer days, and there are plenty available. Beach Read is a little heavier, and as a more mature reader I appreciated the mix of light and dark.The reason for the lacking star is the slow start. It takes awhile for the author to build the story and early on the construction of her sentences made some parts difficult to understand causing me to have to re-read several sentences. I feel like about a third of the way into the book she found her rhythm and the pace picked up for me.Recommendation: It was a slow start but well worth the finish. A great beach read for my summer quarantine sans the beach.Until next time ...

443,451524934,5,"Classic read, although not really ""sci-fi""",5 people found this helpful,"It is shocking that the book was written in 1949 but the ideas seem so mind blowing even as I read today. Granted, I never gave much thoughts to dictatorship. I was actually born in 1984, in China. And conveniently I turned out not interested in politics and history at all. The only reason I read this book is because it's categorized as classic ""sci-fi"". But seems, there is no escape of politics after all. *spoiler alert* The book describes the journey to ultimate darkness. It reminds me of ""The Forever War"" and a Japanese anime called ""Evangeline"". They all to some extend depict the effort of diminishing individual differences and creating one unified consciousness for all mankind. It's ironic to see the ultimate development of human consciousness might be to destroy it for once and for all. The most interesting thing about 1984 is that O'Brian says the motivation of the Party is purely selfish and hunger of power. That in my opinion is the biggest weakness of the Party. What's good of ""power"", if you spend all your time defending it instead of indulging yourself in the benefits of having power? Surely the ""high"" would sometimes want to slack off and lay back with an empty mind, ironically, similar with the emptiness of the ""middle"" and the ""low""? Oppressing people seems such hard work. Even O'Brian knows he is worn and tired. And the book says itself the ""high"" often goes soft in history. I don't know how the Party gets around it just by ""knowing what it's doing"". Of course it might just be me being childish and naive while on the other hand, the inner party is bunch of super over-achievers. But to me, the real dangerous lunatics are the ones who actually believe what they do is for the mankind.

Sadly, this is a fail in my opinion.While not a die hard Smith fan, I liked him (generally speaking). However, this memoir has me changing my mind. Will has always come off as ""annoying"" to me and the first several chapters let me understand WHY. It's just who he IS. Initially, I was turning pages like lightning, at times laughing out loud and at others shaking my head at his profound ""corniness"". The stories were fun, interesting, and insightful.  His cockiness is present from the beginning, but not necessarily bothersome. Then, about halfway through, he takes a nosedive...The light-hearted story of Smith's life morphs into a self-important bragathon which is very hard to read. I didn't realize Will is SO full of himself! My goodness, there's one thing to be confident or competitive even, but this guy is downright arrogant! So many times, I've closed this book and put it to the side (because he was simply getting on my nerves).Another thing I didn't enjoy was the inssecant need to dumb things down. As a Philly native, it was nice to know most of his references to the city. However, the constant explanations of words and phrases was unnecessary and often condescending. I don't know much about Mark Manson but I imagine the many self-help/psychoanalysis portions are from him. I could do without these as they don't sound genuine and disrupt the natural flow.It seems the intention was to inspire and/or uplift, but to have the desired effect, Will Smith seriously needs a lesson in humility! I suppose it could possibly come at the very end as I have been 360+ pages in for months now and just can't finish the darn book!

I highly recommend as another wonderful read by JG. I look forward to reading more of her stories and meeting some of the people I know again. I love how authors do that.

The author does a great job at adding suspense right at the end of a chapter to tease and compel you into reading more.My only critique, and the reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is that at some points the pacing felt a bit slow for my tastes. Mysteries would hang for a little too long, descriptions and scene building would take a little too much attention away from dialog and developments, but it didn't ruin the experience.This was a gripping read from start to finish, and I would recommend it to anyone considering it.",True,mystery,1.0,1.0,1.0

Loved the first few albums. I don't know if Grohl is planning on writing a second book because there's a lot missing here. At 376 pages, you'd expect more meat, less sugary prose. Very little on Nirvana, almost nothing on the debacle firing of past Foo members, no Taylor Hawkins OD story, no Letterman final gig, no insight on songwriting and no mention how's he gone from singer to screamer.What there is a lot of, however, is sweetness and light. A lot of aw, shucks, how did I get here. Gee, do I deserve all this. A lot of, oh man, there's Paul McCartney, there's Little Richard, there's John Fogerty, here's every artist I admired as a kid, HOW DID I GET HERE?!

547,B01IW9TM5O,5,Eye opening,One person found this helpful,"In simple terms this is a book by a comedian. In realistic terms its an eye opener, at least for me personally.Noah defines how his mere existence is a crime........why? you ask - one word-""apartheid"".Now we all know that word. We may have learnt it as a vocabulary word or maybe as a general knowledge term or maybe as a chapter in a history/ civics class but you read the book and then it hits you - the enormity of this one word. The pain, the suffering, the so lopsided and so deeply unfair power weilding of one human race over another.Noah calls his existence a crime because during his time the union between a white and black was just that - a criminal offence. The book details his journey as a teen struggling in this society trying to find his identity and justification of his existence. He details his relationship with his equally rebellious mother and the time he enjoyed with his father. I wish he would say more about his emergence as a comedian and how he ended up across the Atlantic but maybe that is another book. For now this book is an eye opener at least for the uninitiated as me into the dark realities of aparthaeid and the life and struggles of a biracial human.Its Trevor Noahs book, humor is inevitable and there is lots of it and does help ease the heartache that is bound to accompany  you as u progress into the book.Very good read indeed.",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

560,786965606,5,I pretty much ignored 3,8 people found this helpful,"I started playing D&D 28 yrs ago as a player in 1st ed.  I then went on to run several long campaigns in 2nd ed, including through the ""Players Options"" period towards the end.  I pretty much ignored 3.0, and took some time off.  3.5 got me fired up and I ran 2 more long campaigns with those rules, one of which I continue to run currently.  Never touched 4th.  I've been ignoring 5th, and Pathfinder for that matter, because I'm so heavily invested in my current campaign and I don't just drop things and start over because ""newer, cooler"" stuff comes out.3.5 really began bothering me once my group hit 9th level or so.  I still considered myself new to it, I had never played high levels in it, and I held out with 2nd ed. for so long I totally missed 3.0, and frankly, by the time I started playing 3.5 it was very old.  So I really didn't know what to expect from 3.5 and it takes me a couple years to really grasp all the pros and cons of a system, and also to understand the way it's rules subtly effect the way people play, and the actual flavor of the game.  Going into it, I was excited about 3.5.  They appeared to both streamline and unify things with the d20 core mechanic.  I liked what they did with the classes.  I likes the artwork, and I thought the indepth skill system and the idea behind feats were both really cool..in theory...In play, as both player and DM there was this feeling of being held back, and it was hard to pin down, and it just got worse the longer I played.  3.5 was difficult to run if you honor the rules and like to do things legit like I do.  Don't get me wrong, winging it is a time honered tradition and an artform I love, but I also enjoy keeping to the rules in a way that feels both realistic and fun for everyone.  I believe the  very rules of the game themselves can be a inspiration for stories, themes, and ideas, for both players and dms.Anyways, I'll stop now because this is not supposed to be a review of 3.5.Got the 5th ed PHB.  I was blown away.  This reminded me of something that had almost died, a deep desire to imagine and play, it reminded me why I love this game so much, and it really brought me back to the kind of game I want to be playing.  Here are the highlights 5th ed has added or changed:-First, I applaud the writers.  3.5 edition books were tedious to read.  The rules read like text from a technical manual.  The fluff was either cliche, or trying so hard to be different that it came across again as, cliche. This entire book is just interesting and inspiring to read.  I literally get adventure ideas from every other paragraph, it's just easy enough that you could hand it to your little brother and he could struggle through it, yet rich enough, deep enough, intelligent enough that you don't feel lame reading it as an adult.-The have made your character's background actually important.  For instance, if you're fighter was a criminal, he might be really good a sneaking around in addition to beating people up, but it he grew up in a temple, he might be versed on religious studies, as so fourth.  Each character picks a background which gives them a few skills and a lot of flavor.  There's more to it, but it's nice this game has finally brought character background into the mix in a formal way, instead of being just this thing you ""should come up with"", that a lot of people ignore, or gloss over.  Where you came from now effects your character, and at the same time gives you another layer of customization without complicating things too much.-Combat is less herky-jerky.  They've somehow simplified things without taking away variety.  In fact, in a couple sessions I played, it just felt like you could get more done with your round.  They've also added in reactions, so different classes have the opportunity to interrupt the flow of the round and sneak something in that can change the battle or save the day.  People have a lot more reason to pay attention when it's not their turn, because they may have a chance to act.-They changed the way spells work in a way that nearly brought tears to my eyes...so much simpler, much more flexible, and still all the variety there was before in spells.All in all I can't put this book down and can't wait to start a new group.  5th edition appears to really empower the DM, without taking away options from the players.  I don't know if this makes sense to anyone, but the direction 5th is taking feels more like a fantasy game, and less like a superhero game.  It feels a bit like 2nd edition, but still keeps the d20 core mechanic, and makes tangible, rather brilliant improvements on many areas of the game.  I have to applaud WOtC, for doing this right beyond what I thought was possible.  I didn't know if the spirit of the game could be recaptured after 3.5 and from what I've heard, 4th ed, turned it into an escalating numbers game that felt like WOW on paper.  The rules add to the story now, instead of burdening it.  The rules make combat exciting now instead of slowing it down.  Magic feels magical again instead of being a handful of dice doing fire damage.  D&D is back, it had regained its soul.  If you've been out of the game for years because it just stopped feeling right to you, if you miss the game, if you're playing Pathfinder/3.5 but you're tired of the cold war/numbers escalations between you and your DM, and especially if you're tired of battles taking 3+hours, and being mentally exhausted because of the constant need to track so many numbers, if you're a gamer and you're curious about the godfather of all games, you should really check this out.  There is so much content and flavor in this book.  I paid $30 for it but would have been just as excited to pay more for it...it's just the best thing I've seen in some time.",True,humor_entertainment,1.0,1.0,1.0

In that very distant past, Macy meets Elliot, the neighbor boy at her family's vacation home, who turns out to love reading as much as she does. What begins as a shared appreciation for literature morphs into friendship and then something more. But because they only see each other when Macy's family vacations, it's hard to pull a label on what ""more"" means to them.Then something happens that tears Macy and Elliot apart (this is kept hidden from the reader), and they don't see each other for 11 years. Flash to the present when Macy unexpectedly runs into Elliot, and it shakes the fragile foundation she reconstructed after the incident. A lot can change in 11 years, but one thing is certain: her feelings for Elliot aren't as finished as she thought.I finished this book in a single sitting. It was that good.

566,1984806734,4,Worth the Hype,,"This book? Definitely worth the hype. Let me give you three reasons why:1. This book has the BEST writer's/character's voice I've read in a while. I was completely sucked into January's life from the first sentence: ""I have a fatal flaw."" She's a totally relatable character, and even when she's not relatable, you can't help but watch the train wreck that's inevitably going to happen. She's clever, witty, salty, and she strikes a perfect balance of naivety and realism. Honestly, she's one of my favorite character I've had the pleasure of stalking. I didn't want to un-stalk her at any point.2. If you're looking for a new OTP, you need only pick up this book. I don't want to say too much, but the passionate tension between January and Gus is strong enough to exist off the page and make you remember their witty and sometimes-deep conversations when you're doing all the mundane things in your life. Also, the whole deal with them both being writers is something so fascinating to me, and them swapping genres for the summer and teaching each other about their genre tropes made my writing-nerd heart sing. I can't say enough about January and Gus (besides the fact that I still feel like their names belong in some YA romance novel that involves cancer or another life-threatening disease).3. If my number two reason didn't cook your grits, this one better. This book isn't just about romance. Obviously there's other plot-lines, but get this: they are interesting plot lines not because unique and crazy things happen but because January seems like a real person, and you want to be involved in every detail of her life. Her character growth (and Gus's, actually) is incredible.These three reasons should be enough to encourage you to pick up the book, especially if you already like romances and reading about angsty writers who live somewhat solitary lives. It's a perfectly lovely book that dives deeper than just romance, and really makes you wonder if you're the optimist or the pessimist in life. I promise, it's enjoyable to read this book.(Some may wonder why I'm not giving it five stars. It takes an incredible contemporary/romance/non-fantasy to make me give something five stars. While I really enjoyed this book, I can't imagine I'd read it again anytime soon, and it didn't make me feel as much as I wanted to. It's just an incredibly good book.

I no longer had the time and the idea of dedicating my little free time to even more reading made no sense to me and filled me with dread. I'm now a recent college graduate and this is the first book I've read in my free time in years. I tore through it in four days, and it would've been less had I not been working.Jennette is an incredibly skilled writer. She has a command over words that is gimmick-less and true. She simply writes things they way they are and the way she sees them, and it is incredibly striking. She writes of events in her life that resonated deeply and miserably with me, and events that struck me with horrified, disgusted awe--behaviors so unimaginable that it horrifies me this came from a place of reality. Needless to say, I was often in tears reading this.[Mild and non-specific spoilers below.]Towards the end, I was crying because of just how proud of Jennette I was. Reading of her finally craving a grip on her life, creating a healthier relationship with control, developing boundaries, regaining herself--it all struck me with an intense sense of joy and sheer pride. I can only imagine the strength this journey took--not just writing the book, but reliving the memories, and all of the processing and recovery that came before it.I'm left wanting more. What I'm personally interested in (and what have loved to read) was an expansion on how she came to terms with her mother being abusive. I don't imagine her revisiting this topic in a book, though, so perhaps I'll look to interviews. Regardless, I look greatly forward to whatever she puts out next. I am certain she will make it magic.Overall, a fantastic read for those who can stomach the intense, vivid, and plainly-stated.
