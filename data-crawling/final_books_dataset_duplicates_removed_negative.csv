1647222613,1.0,Don't buy it. Complete garbage!,,"Complete waste of money. I knew going into this that it would probably be a bunch of useless things, but this was beyond my poor expectations. What was spread across 25 days could have been done in 5 because things just repeated themselves over and over. And they weren't even good things. Stickers, but really poor quality stickers. Recipe cards, I'm not sure I'll ever try one, but ok. Quotes, why do I need quotes or scene cards? Gift tags, I'll accept but when it is the gift more than once, it gets annoying.

Most of the days are a picture from a scene of an episode (lame). There were a couple of recipe cards which were cool. So maybe 5-7 of the gifts out of 25 days were worth it, but mostly it was a big let down.",TRUE,humor_entertainment

It's basically a bunch of paper cards with references to the show. I didn't have unrealistic expectations, but I would have liked to see something with better quality. It's not worth the money they charge, it's insanely over priced and a waste of money. I could have bought a cute Friends T-Shirt or mug instead.

1647222613,1.0,Don’t waste your money.,,This was very disappointing. My daughter loves the show and I got this for her. Several cheap cardboard ornaments and a couple of Christmas tags that the string broke. I think one ugly pin and a thin pack of post it notes are the “best” items.

We have purchased advent calendars in the past and this is by far the worst one yet. Every other one we have done has had trinkets and tangible items that were at least fun. This is a bunch of crappy paper products that frankly don't live up to a $20 price tag. Stickers and cardboard is all there is to be had here. Skip this and spend your money on a Lego or Funko advent calendar, because those are at least worth the $$.

By the way, his definitions of heroes like the Japanese soldier who hid in the Philippine jungle for 30 years murdering innocent people and burning their crops is insane.

I went in with an open mind, but could barely finish this book. While there were some good points made early on (such as, we should concentrate on things that matter, like family and friends), there was little substance in about 150 pages of this 200 page book. Mr. Manson describes in detail the thoughts of several deceased persons, from Beatles drummer Pete Best to a WWII Japanese soldier, but does not reference the sources of his information. He theorizes that many of women's accusations of sexual misconduct by men are ""false memories"" and that men have been harmed in the process without recognizing the impact of this very real phenomenon of sexual misconduct on our culture. Regarding his account of how sometimes his wife ""doesn't look great"", and he suggests she change her clothes/hairstyle....just, wow. We'll see how that works out when she attains some confidence. I have to think that his ""wildly popular"" blog is followed primarily by readers much younger than Mr. Manson.

This book basically just says, ""Hey, stop caring about a bunch of stuff"" and then leaves it at that. Maybe some folks are into it, but to me it was less than inspiring and not at all novel.

As someone who has read some self-help books, this is probably the worst I've come across. Example: He describes life like climbing a rope, and says ""The joy is in the climb itself."" Seriously?

B019MMUA8S,1.0,Pure fad! Poor unsubstantiated writing based on one person's life experience turned cure-all advice for others.,"1,695","Sorry, not sorry, but not a fan. This book is pretty much written by a person who had crisis in their life (as many do) and wrote a whole book of life-advice based on their single experience. This book seems to be heavily influenced by taking what Mark learned from his therapist, based on his personal issues, and transforming that into a set of principles that will somehow act as a cure-all for everyone else's situations...with the word ""F*CK added to be cool. This is pretty much a fad that will eventually fade away. Definitely not one of the long-standing classics. Good job to this guy for getting paid on it though. I'd get my money back if I could. Here are the parts that stick out to me in particular: 1. The writing isn't that great. He drops the f-bomb here and there for emphasis which is attention getting. But if you're adding the f-bomb to writing that is not well developed...well you're just emphasizing poor writing. Personally, I'm not a prude and have no issues with the word. I just didn't think it was effective in this case. 2. This book is not inspirational and there is nothing profound in here that most people don't already learn on their own from life itself when transitioning from late teen years to early adulthood. Waste of time. 3. There are many claims about what psychologists and other experts believe. A lot of ""Research shows..."" but there are no citations! Ummm, what? How do we know what Mark summarizes is indeed what research shows. Where is the foundation on which the proof points of this book is written? ""Sometime in the 1960s, developing ""high self-esteem""-having positive thoughts and feelings about oneself-became all the rage in psychology. Research found that people who thought highly about themselves generally performed better and cause d fewer problems...Grade inflation, for example, was implemented to make low achieving kids feel better...Pastors and minsters told their congregations that they were each uniquely special in God's eyes...Businesses and motivational seminars cropped up chanting the same paradoxical mantra: every single one uf us can be exceptional and massively successful."" Really? How about an example or citation of where this was pulled together. ""Numerous professors and educators have noted a lack of emotional resilience and and excess of selfish demands in today's young people...Speakers and professors are shouted down and banned from campuses for infractions as simple as suggesting that maybe some Halloween costumes really aren't that offensive. Schools counselors note that more students than ever are exhibiting severe signs of emotional distress..."" Ok. Who? Where? What? When and where are these things happening? Where are the studies, examples, news references? Where is this guy pulling all of this from? My goodness a 5th grader could write a more complete current event report than the content of this entire book! The acknowledgements state ""To Michael Covell for being my intellectual stress test, especially when it comes to understanding psychological research, and for always challenging me on my assumptions."" Well good job for trying Michael! ""Brilliant business people are often f*ckups in their personal lives. Extraordinary athletes are often shallow and dumb as a lobotomized rock.

I think the author will be quite embarrassed by this book when he becomes an adult (unless of course it made him a boatload of money). I especially laughed at the section of ""honest relationships"" as he discussed his wife's disappointment that he had not appreciated her outfit for an event and she had to go change. Wouldn't a non-chauvinistic and less entitled perspective have been that women should dress for themselves, and not have their identity and self-value linked with how a man/husband/friend sees them?

I am a writer and my tales start with a hook to draw you in, knowing that it will end in something positive. Honestly, I gave up and so was unwilling to read until the end, in fact I was unwilling to read beyond eight pages. A writer grabs the reader with a hook of some sort. I was initially intrigued by the title. I thought it was funny and that it had a funny way of raising your spirits. Boy, I was wrong; that is, I was wrong after a few pages. It regardless of whether or not the book ends well, the author definitely did not draw me in. The lead character was an alcoholic, rude person who didn't have any interest in becoming any better. He was happy being a waste, someone who ate and died. Perhaps that could be the reason for you actually getting better, but honestly, a writer shouldn't GRAB the reader with such a horrible person's life. Ugh. I understand the necessity to relax more and not be so strung out. In a library or bookstore, I might have initially grabbed the book because of the title, but I would have promptly put it back down.

However, he drones on and on about how his girlfriend cheated on him or how getting caught possessing marijuana was so traumatic for him (you know, stuff he himself deemed as minor). Maybe he had a miserable home life? Maybe he was getting beaten every day by his alcoholic parent and that’s why he sought relief in drug use? Nope. Turns out he was privileged all along. Attended college on his parents’ dime and never had to really hold down a job. Within a year of writing a garbage blog, he travels to fifty five countries only to have the nerve to complain about it. He spent so much time in this book saying how your trauma or your pain isn’t special and if you think it is you are entitled.

B019MMUA8S,1.0,Just Another Pep-Talk Style Money Grab,52,"First of all, this book is an obvious money grab. It's just a beefed up version of his most popular blog post. There is no new information in the book, it's just been significantly lengthened with anecdotes, personal stories, and couple of studies that are only vaguely relevant to the topic at hand. Apparently even this wasn't enough to make something he could justify charging people for, so he also opted for large font, wide spacing, and thick margins. That did the trick. Now introducing... (drum roll)... The Exact Same Blog Post (Now 857% Longer) As far as content, don't be fooled by the forced humor and edgy language, this is just another disposable, pep-talk style self-help book that follows the same basic formula as a thousand others, and provides no satisfying reasons to think the advice therein is worthwhile. Most of this book is comprised either of Mark pontificating on the keys to a happy life (based almost exclusively on personal experience) and/or ranting about ""our"" skewed priorities. Speaking of, the ""our"" was a major pet peeve of mine... He speaks in the ubiquitous self-help ""we/our/us"" throughout the entire book. ""We fear,"" ""we want,"" ""we try,"" ""we always,"" ""we need to,"" ""we should..."" We who? You mean you? It's one thing to take truths of psychology or human behavior at large and assume they probably apply to one's self. It's another thing entirely to take truths about one's self (in this case Mark's self) and assume they apply to humanity at large. Mark spends the entire book doing the latter. Something worked or didn't work for him, did or did not make him happy,was or was not a profoun experience, so he insists we should all think/act/be/do the same. Anyway, I know the edgy title has your interest piqued, so if you're dead-set on hearing what he has to say, I'm tellin' ya, just save yourself the four hours and $20 and just read the much more succinct source material.",TRUE,humor_entertainment

B019MMUA8S,1.0,An utter waste of time,14,"An utter waste of time. If you've read any business book or attended an annual business conference in the last decade, you already know every illustrative ""example"" that Mr. Manson presents. In addition, he repeats his opening premise again, and again, to the point where you want to scream at him, ""Do you think I'm stupid?? Get to the point, man!"" I imagine that as blog posts, each piece could be valuable, coming back to a central theme of the blog. But as a book, it's rubbish. Then comes the arrogant moralism: ""You are responsible for dealing with everything that has happened to you."" Mr. Manson tries to split semantical hairs; e.g., others are ""to blame,"" but you are ""responsible."" But as he gives no account at all of the massive psychological damage that childhood abuse does to rational decision-making, it ends up being just more ""Dr. Laura/Phil-ultra-conservative-punditry-masquerading-as-therapy"" claptrap. (One wonders what a licensed mental health medical professional might have suggested as edits.) Victims of abuse are not inherently capable of making the same rational decisions that others take for granted. That's kinda why it's called ""abuse."" It takes intensive therapy—and yes, significant effort on the abused—to get to a place where the abused can trust others, and make better decisions with long-term impacts. Also, there is the repeated insistence that the author ""gives no f—,"" about what he's written, while ignoring the fact that purposefully completing the process of writing, editing, publishing and promoting an actual bound & printed book is prima facie evidence of ""giving a f—."" Mr. Manson fatally wounds his only positive argument. Lastly: dude, you probably need to talk to someone about your obsession with sex. It's a little icky. Again: blog posts ≠ book. There are so many superior alternatives if you're looking for how to deal with OCD, anxiety (especially modern, tech-driven anxiety) or past abusive relationships. If you number among those unfortunate people (Hi, and welcome!), it is _not_ your fault, and things do get better, with work and qualified help.

B019MMUA8S,1.0,Another superfluous self help book,,"This book contains so many false facts it is mind bugling. After dipping a bit into CBT, which he believes can be done without the help of a qualified councilor, the author gives us life advice which he claims is evidence based, but in fact he just cherry picks cases, examples, and studies to support his own opinion. I only read to advise four, then I had had enough of someone who in a rather condescending tone tries to convince me of things that I know for a fact are wrong. Take advise four fex., basically the old saying that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. The author refers to a small study on Polish WW2 survivors to underpin this claim, but ignores the enormous academic literature on the effect of severe and/or persistent stress on the brain and the many epidemiological studies who show that previously traumatized individuals are less able to cope with catastrophes than their non traumatized peers, which is the exact opposite of what the author claims. I could pick each wrong claim in this book to pieces but the result would be the same. This book is written by a person who is totally and utterly unqualified to give life advice, someone who neither holds a background in psychology, nor psychiatry, nor coaching, nor philosophy. If you believe that a blogger with a background in finance who earns a living by doling out pep talks with flashy titles is the most qualified person to give you evidence based advice on how to live your life, then all I can say is good luck.",TRUE,humor_entertainment

His grasp of psychology is pretty thin ( a few months of Psychology Today). His humility is non existent. He's sanctimonious and meandering in his writing. He's basically taken a blog and stretched it for 200 pages. The basic point is figure out what matters in your life and go for it and if you're doing other things that distract you from that, stop doing those things.

Uses obtuse quotes to prove an obtuse point, his writing is convoluted and difficult to follow - and I'm not Biden. I run a very successful business and I can work through almost any type of writing. If this is the way he really runs his life, I feel sorry for him. Or maybe it is just me. Maybe this is the way most people think.

B019MMUA8S,1.0,35-Year Old Figures Out the Meaning of Life (after smoking lots of weed),14,"One of the suggestions in this book is to ""do something"", and so I'm following the advice and writing a review. The first couple of chapters were okay and stated (in Manson's unique way) many obvious things that most grown ups already know: pay attention to what you value, don't sweat the small stuff, life isn't fair...deal with it. The problem is that Manson is a walking contradiction. He says his adolescence was horrible and traumatic, but that's not the picture he paints. He went to a Christian school after being kicked out of his public school for having weed in his locker. Doh! As punishment, his dad made him work in an office and file papers. Ouch! Can you imagine? Working in an office??? Sorry but living in a wealthy household, going to a Christian school and having an office job is not traumatic. It's cushy. Meanwhile, much the ""humor"" in the book is what comedy writers refer to as ""shock"" humor. It's basically an attempt to make people laugh by using politically incorrect or obscene language, as in: ""My family stonewalls like Warren Buffett makes money or Jenna Jameson f****"" Or, the ole 1, 2, 3 list, where you list two things and a third outrageous one: ""We start to feel as though something is wrong with us, which drives us to all sorts of overcompensation, like buying forty pairs of shoes or downing Xanax with a vodka chaser, or shooting up a school bus full of kids."" Yep, he went there. Talk about tone deaf. Very painful sentence to read a couple of weeks after Uvalde. Tone deaf. And, if you're looking for marital advice from a guy who has been married maybe five years (I don't know how long...not long), Manson has lots of relationship advice to share. Conflict is okay and it's okay to tell your wife she looks bad. Demean your wife...that's always a good plan. Also, you should know, commitment will change your life, folks. Manson had an epiphany after he got married: commitment is where it's at. Thanks bud! The last chapter is a rambling rant about how bad he feels because he was getting drunk and high with his friend Josh who, in his intoxication, ended up at the bottom of a lake. But, Manson was too busy chasing a ""pretty Asian girl"". So, in the last chapter, after reading chapter after chapter about the perils of having bad values, he twice refers to this young lady he's chasing as the ""Asian girl"". That's an example of his great values. She doesn't have a name. We don't know what she looks like. Apparently, the only thing that matters to him, she was pretty and Asian. But don't worry because, according to Manson, Josh's death taught him a lot. After that, he ""gave up the weed and the cigarettes and the video games"". Sacrifices! How this book stays on the bestseller list, and all the five-star reviews, is beyond me. The book is beyond horrible. He should have waited 30 years to write it.",TRUE,humor_entertainment

Well first don't give an F about just anything, but pick the things you want to give an F about. Keep in mind the title of the book is literally about not giving an F. The guy has no premise, and the writing sort of meanders through his half-baked ideas around poorly-articulated concepts and anecdotes. In the last chapter he tried to get creative with his writing style. Couldn't do it; I quit with three pages to go. You know how they bar lawyers from every practicing again?

The first type of advice is common sense ideas that nearly any adult already knows (for example, that you can’t do everything well and need to prioritize, or that family is important). The second, more frequent type of advice the author offers are ideas that are often unfounded, and (for many people in many situations) are likely to be unhelpful or even harmful. For most, this book has little to offer. Consider that even the title of the book uses language inaccurately. (The title indicates the approach offered is ""subtle"" - this is by no means the case. Much of the advice suggests radical changes that would be very obvious to others around you). Some might argue that the misuse of ""subtle"" is intentional; that the author is employing sardonic humor. Perhaps.

The page that really threw me off that made me stop reading the book in is the picture I attached to this review. I understand the authors statement “we are responsible for everything that happens in our lives” meaning we can control how we react to and see different situations, but one man got offended by that because his son was killed in a car accident and the author applied that same ideology to that incident.

B019MMUA8S,1.0,An adolescents adaptive view to feeling better. This opens people to failure and more time spent lost in confusion.,10,"I can easily see the attraction of this book. It lacks depth, depth from any new perspective that will honestly help anyone with their emotional advancement, or anything close to a good life. It touches on many half truths adopted by Buddhism and other sources of gum-drop metaphysics. It uses old outdated models such as Buddhism and current psychology to make points aligned with an adolescent viewpoint. A perspective where people should accept pain as a part of everyday life, relegates dreaming to fantasies not best indulged because it incites pain, forget about the future, (where the future is the source of all healing) diminish the values of emotion, create a set of “acceptable values”, rather than values based in one’s personal character. Like most self help books, it is filled with “half-truths” which can create more problems over a longer period for people. The author also states, Happiness as in unsolvable equation, (which it is easily solved when you know what it is). He also states, “suffering is a sign of growth”, when clearly suffering is the function of a lack of growth and change. Pain is something to release, not carry with you. He makes a multitude of sophomoric statements, “life is meant to be an”Iterative” process.” This is ridiculous. If you are repeating ANY patterns you are essentially living in the past. Patterns are there simply for one to gain understanding in where they are not evolving, they are meant to be released, the sooner the better. “No man steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he is not the same man.” Heraclitus He made two positive points, commitment is the path to greater freedom, and values are something a person needs to operate from. Although he didn’t understand how to incorporate the values. Values are how an adult decides on what they will and will not do, they are the positive boundaries which we choose to operate from. They are individual and subjective and when wisely chosen will be ideals, so that they are never changed. If you change your values, how can you be trustworthy? If you deeply relate to this book, you are operating as an adolescent, regardless of your age. Adulthood is a conscious transformational choice from adolescence to adulthood. If you don’t understand that, and cannot make a choice like that, you can only operate from the past. (Child or adolescent, not adult) This author’s greatest transformational moment was at 19 when his friend died, which could only be transformative, and not transformational. Our greatest challenge in society right now is the lack of adults on this planet. Look at the world, it seems high school all over again, just like this book. Most of the world is in adolescent, including the author. Sadly, I’m not surprised this is a best seller.",TRUE,humor_entertainment

525522131,1.0,Not Relevant For Modern Feminists,7.0,"I have empathy towards the author's obvious ptsd-a childhood without true affection of either parent, followed by the untimely deaths of both parents in her early adulthood. I appreciate her humor in a time of absolute crisis-picture Daria if she wrote a book in college in NYC in similar situations-however, she completely lost me when she depicts calling her on again, off again abusive boyfriend and lies about being sexually assaulted for attention. I understand she was under copious amounts of prescription drugs and not in her right mind, but those few lines incensed me. Lying about sexual harassment and sexual assault was a rule far before the current stages of the feminist movement. There is never an excuse for lying about a plague people have endured in our society, and have been often shunned because of people who fall into the 2-5% range of people that lie about sexual assault. Rape is not gender specific, but since this obviously caters towards women...how many women have forward with their stories of sexual assault and been gaslighted because men have stores like her ex? ""I once knew a girl that lied..."" She is part of the problem all sexually assaulted persons have had to bear the burden of responsibility for, on top of their anguish of truly being asualted. I do not completely blame the author. She wrote this describing who she was in state of mind where she can't be held accountable, even if she manipulated her doctor into over medicating her...yet it makes a reader wonder, if she lied about sexual assault-what else is she lying about? She has a partial share in the responsibility of those lines being published, but that responsibility grows the higher every step taken by those who published her. Someone should have had the foresight to edit this out. This book was highly reviewed in female oriented magazines earlier this year. Apologies need to be stated by those that propagated this literature-mind you-in the #metoo era. I am a fair person, I stopped reading when I came upon the passage I described earlier.

525522131,1.0,"Incomprehensible turgid drivel, self-obsessed central character, no plot, no point",16.0,"I saw this praised in a national newspaper - 'must read' , 'darkly comedic', 'hilarious', 'intriguing'. Well OK, that sounds interesting, so I paid over £4 for the book. I wish that I hadn't. This book was repetitive, dull, failed to engage, and had 2D characters that you could not identify with nor care about. The lack of any form of plot or growth of any of the characters is the elephant in the room. You spend the time wondering why a privileged and rich young woman would have anything to complain about, and it seems that actually, she doesn't have anything to complain about. No good reason is ever produced to explain why she is dossing around off her face on drugs instead of just living her life. She has a friend who she doesn't like, an ex that she pesters, and a therapist that she lies to. She knows an artist that she claims to hate, then she stars in his next art exhibition. It's all bollocks. If you need a pharmaceutical reference book handy then this might serve, as it goes into highly repetitive detail on the various drugs that she takes and their effects, and what combinations work best. The whole premise of this book seems to be skewed when you realise that for most of this year she isn't actually hibernating! It turns out that she is going out of her flat and doing things, it's just that the drugs she uses prevents her from remembering what she is doing - the evidence of her activities are there when she wakes up. So she isn't actually hibernating at all, she is just wandering around off her face on drugs. It is hard to find sympathy with or empathy for a character that appears to have nothing really to complain about in her life, and has had everything handed to her on a plate. Nothing bad has ever happened to her, she has never struggled with anything worse than apathy. She is rich enough to be able to choose to just sit in her apartment and do nothing for a whole year. How many of us could choose to do the same thing? The main character fails to understand how lucky she is and does not improve over time. There is no sense of relief when she finally exits her apartment, because frankly, who cares? She isn't contributing to society nor interacting with life. She is an unlikable person who has failed to make any effort to interact with people and make friends. You have the feeling that if she died in her apartment then no-one would either notice or care, and neither would the reader. She stops taking drugs completely one day but suffers no adverse reactions to suddenly halting the tsunami of chemicals that she has been subjecting her body to on a daily basis. This is surprising and quite jarring. The author has taken a lot of pain to describe the drugs and their side effects, yet has written nothing over the hideous result of stopping all the drugs at once? It is complete nonsense. In fact, why bother stopping the drugs at all, as it doesn't seem to be stopping the central character living a life of privileged idleness. I couldn't find the 'comedic' aspects of this book. Unless the nasty comments about her only friend and how she is uses her friend are supposed to be funny, or maybe the other characters? Perhaps her interactions of lying to her therapist are meant to be the hilarious bit? It's hard to tell. I've had funnier ingrowing toenails. I would very much like to meet the reviewers that gave this book five stars, just to find out whether they actually read more than the first five pages, or whether they were simply paid to write something positive. Looking at some of the reviews and having read the full book, it's hard to see that we actually read the same book. In summary, I'd swerve this turgid and boring tale of a privileged rich young woman who spends a year going 'Woe is me! Poor me!'. I feel that this book is the literary equivalent of the starving artist that is acclaimed for creating a painting made with their own poop and menstrual blood, claiming that it is a 'bold personal statement on society' and both 'challenging and edgy', and 'thought provoking', instead of just calling it crap on canvas.

To be clear, I have no issue with unlikeable protagonists, and I love dark humor and satire, but there's nothing remotely interesting about this book. Our gorgeous 20something narrator works in a Manhattan art gallery and decides to process grief over her parents' death by taking a year off in a haze of prescription meds and booze. And since the book kicks off in late 2000, it's pretty clear the story of her year will climax with 9/11. And so the reader spends endless pages watching her attempt to sleep through the year. She's flush with money, but seems to have almost no human connections -- there's one friend, whom she finds incredibly annoying and does her best to push away. She has a finance-bro jerk ex-boyfriend she makes booty calls to. There's a space-cadet shrink who gives her whatever prescriptions she wants. And there are the Egyptian guys in the bodega by her building, and that's about it. I guess one might see it all as some kind of raw, unflinching portrait of depression, but it's certainly not an interesting one. It's hard not to read it as a ""poor little rich (and gorgeous) girl"" woe-is-me story, and then 9/11 comes along to knock her out of it? It's actually kind of offensive.

Also, NONE of the other characters are enjoyable, interesting, or sympathetic. I also don't understand how anyone found this funny.

By far the worst is his his irritating ""humor"" pounded in by constant repetition of very silly, stupid acts or speeches delivered by the very predictable, wanna-be-odd characters (as to make them more endearing? Try again) killed it for sure. Nothing is worse than someone repeating a bad joke to make sure the audience got it. Well, this book was an amazing collection of bad jokes. I half-read another of the author's books (just couldn't get through with it) and realized that this is just how he writes. Terrible. And the plot got crazier by the minute. Are we still in Sweden?

This book is the first of Ms Moriarty’s books that is terrible. To begin, the plot is wildly improbable and even pernicious. Nine people have signed up for a transformative spa retreat not knowing that the program will involve illegal drugs inflicted on them without their consent by a megalomaniac madwoman. The pernicious part is that it is all too easy for the nine of them once the book draws to a close—where are the medical after effects? To say nothing of being overly easy on the madwoman, who is guilty of too many crimes to count. The characters are trivial, and Masha (the madwoman) is utterly unbelievable. She also gives me a poor opinion of the Australian medical system, because she should never have been running around loose, let alone been as successful as she seems to be. If you want to read a book with a similar plot, the analogy to which has appeared in many discussions of this book, read And Then There Were None, by Agatha Christie. I would call Nine Perfect Strangers a satire on the Christie novel, except that I don’t think it is intended to be funny, and I certainly detected no humor in it whatsoever.

(SPOILER ALERT) The characters discover their hostess has been feeding them LSD-laced smoothies...and she's unhinged. The end is a summary of where everyone ends up months from the conclusion of the story--with more points of view, including one of a character who was only mentioned before. One of the more likeable characters in the book is a romance writer whose career (at least in her own mind) is failing, and she decides to try something new. Is that what's happening here?

I hate to see an author’s decline after her writing gets popular. Personally, I think the more popular an author becomes, the more ineffective the editorial team seems to be. Are they afraid of losing this author? Is this why the story editor called this author and said “wow this is a hit novel”, when it obviously isn’t? Or perhaps it’s just easier to take a push broom and sweep all this trash to the public knowing they’ll probably buy it. And unfortunately, we do. I’ll keep up with Liane through the public library.

I did however read it all and in the interests of full disclosure laughed out loud once. Just the once when he was describing two unfortunate names given to new babies but that was it. The book is not without merit - it does describe working conditions for junior doctors in such a way as to be a call to arms for those of us keen to protect our NHS - as indeed the author is and his stories are compelling: the NHS is at risk, worth saving and possibly even dangerous for patients in running on a threadbare empty purse.

I know they had names and he had to use initials for anonymity but as far as I am concerned that's all they were to him, just a couple of initials, until the last one when the 'wheels fell off' and he decided he was off!!

Using the suffering of physical and mental abuse transformed into pleadings for parental approval, MM goes off on tangents about how the only way to be a 'man' is to suffer the beatings by his father, and the emotional torture of a totally immature mother. He talks about this journeys in a world of reality and relativity bringing him insight and knowledge as a way of proving to himself that he's worth something, working in an industry that does nothing but create fantasies and make believe. He runs off to far away locations in search of who he is, financed by a society that buys into celebrity worship and then spits it all back to the reader in poorly written, horribly crafted philosophies.

Only, the problem is that he stopped searching and questioning because he'd already won in his mind. That's why it comes off so immature. He was satisfied with himself before he should have been. He hasn't contemplated enough to claim to have the answers. But here are are. He does claim that. And proceeds with a lotta ""look what an awesome-winner"" I am stories. I'm only 2 years younger than MM and I tried to tell myself to keep an open mind. With the right life and attitude a person who is 50ish can know a lot. But this book got tiring.

Why else would he take peyote and get in a cage with a lion and then think he’s more of a man for it? He also spends a lot of time talking about his need to be a father, which is another one of his romanticizations of power, masculinity, and authority that he saw in his father. Oh, and he thinks of women like vending machines for his unfulfilled desires and dreams about them (literally) like they’re concubines for bearing his offspring.

Just not very inspirational reading. Combine that with the various unreadable fonts on some of his quotes he use in the book, that make no sense at all, and you are better off not reading this awful book.

Unfortunately, it was the latter To anyone who has listed to Matthew on a podcast or interview, pretty much all of these stories have been told already. There is nothing new in here I found some of the stories to be disturbing e.g. several of them focused on domestic violence whereas the author seems to find them inspirational, humorous etc. I can't tell. A lot of this just didn't ring true; his 100' tall tree house he built over a summer of never sleeping, walking 15 miles in Africa holding the hand of a wrestler he defeated, burning through $20K of motorcycles on a tour in Europe for $400.

Honestly, I thought he was some chill, progressive dude from Cali. But he came from Texas, from a long line of Republicans... I'd read positive and negative stuff about this book and debated on whether to purchase it. I gave into my curiosity and urge to listen to an audio book by a very attractive actor much older than me. 'Curiosity killed the cat,' is an understatement. As an abuse survivor (who suffered in Texas for a year...), I felt shaken to my core hearing him repeatedly excusing the abusive, deleterious behavior of his parents. His tone and everything else that came with it, was just so menacing and very triggering. I felt terror for his own children, if he has any (gotta look it up). I also felt despair for what he'd endured. He may not feel like a victim, but you can still experience harmful effects from abuse/hitting, sexual assault, witnessing violence and emotional abuse in the home as a child and not realize you did because you lack awareness and knowledge. In fact, the lack of realization, can be a harmful affect. I don't agree with hitting children but what it seems like he was so desperately trying to swat away, goes far beyond that. It's a fear of facing the grief, helplessness, despair and rage, you were forced and terrorized into not feeling as a child that causes these cycles of suffering and pain to repeat themselves. You grow up to feel that your worth as a man (and even woman) is based on not acknowledging current and past painful emotions because it's ""weak"" and to respond with rage and violence instead of well-adjusted empathy when you see this ""weakness"" in others, like your children... But I don't know him, so who knows what's really going on with his life or how much in his book is true or untrue.

However, that being said, this book is terrible. The kind of terrible where I wish I could get the time back that I spent reading it in order to read something else.

He talks about building a 100-foot tree house with stolen lumber and it took him most of summer. This is fascinating, but later he says after they left, he never went back to see if it is there, really? You made such a cool project and you didn't want to show it to anyone? Sure. 3- He talks about a big wrestler that they did wrestle together hold his hand for 15 miles :)))) 15miles walking with a big guy holding your hand? This is 5.5 hours of walking in normal condition, not talking about hike or anything like that. Also, with a guy who is wrestler and big, was he attracted to you or were you attracted to him? Otherwise this just doesn't make sense. Even for lovers! 4- Your talking about being in nightclubs in Hollywood and waving at top model to come sit at your table. One night you were about to do the same with a girl, but you changed your mind and instead of waving, you went an invite her hahahaha, Really you are such a egoistic that you were waving at girls to come sit at your table, this shows your value and principles like that. 5- Finally your finishing with this sentence ""All lives can’t matter until Black Lives Matter more"". If you truly believe in this rather than just saying to fool public, then let people of color star in movies, give them a chance. However, you won't do that, you would still stereotype African American as murderess, thieves, Immigrants as drug dealers and rapist, Middle Easters as terrorists.",FALSE,humor_entertainment

OK - the guy comes from pretty inauspicious circumstances - so kudos to him for making something of his life.

ONE example is the trip he made to Hollywood to try to get a part in a movie and the agent told him to become cool and suggested that he go to Europe for a while. We are to believe that he and two friends went to a stranger in Europe who sold motorcycles who rented them three upscale motorcycles for $400 each. One was eventually wrecked and the dealer comes, picks up the bike and gives the riderless guy a new bike to use. All this is hard to believe. Even harder, when he gets back to Hollywood he is suddenly “cool” and thus begins a successful acting career. I’ve taken several long motorcycle trips and yet, alas, when I came back I was no cooler than I was when I left. The guy mentions a book entitled “the greatest salesman who ever lived” which he tells us changed his life. It depicts Jesus as a leader of 12 guys who was a real salesman and busnessman. The author, like the book, is as deep as a potato chip. I hope he manages to read a real book on Christianity, e.g. Mere Christianity” by C. S. Lewis. I if he is obedient he may acquire some depth.

Even with differences, we Americans have lost the art of speaking and being heard even when differences are present. I have many friends on the left and right and we all agree to speak in a civil manner even with our differences. Our intent is not to forcibly change another but to present an alternative. At the end of the discussion, we shake hands and leave and go our own way. Personally, I do not watch John Oliver; I do not enjoy his humor.

Don't make the same mistake. This is the story of a beautiful fish who is hated and ostrasized by all the other fish in the sea because they envy his beautiful silver scales. I assumed that the moral of the story would have something to do with everyone being beautiful in his or her own way, and that eventually the other fish would come to recognize their own beauty. Unfortunately not. Instead, the Rainbow Fish is harangued and harrassed by his fellow fish until he has given away all but one of his silver scales. In the end he is very happy because he has become popular. The morals of this story are pretty shocking: 1.) It suggests that children should give in to peer pressure. 2.) It teaches children that friendship can be bought. 3.) It says that it is not only right, but a moral imperative, to sacrifice the very essence of yourself for the sake of popularity. 4.) It suggests that popularity is the ultimate good, and that one cannot be happy without it. 5.) It teaches that envy will be rewarded. 6.) It teaches children that it's okay to ostrasize people who are different. 7.) It teaches that rude behavior is acceptable if it gets you want you want. 8.) It suggests (to younger readers in particular, who may not be capable of grasping metaphor) that only outer beauty matters. 9.) It teaches that happiness can be achieved by tearing down or destroying what belongs to others. 10.) It preaches a kind of social Marxism: that there is no value in the uniqueness of an individual, that his worth and his happiness depend on his desire to conform to the values and demands of his peer group.

To me, that’s the epitome of envy. To want EXACTLY what someone else has. I mean, you want a shirt like mine, I get it, but you want the one I am wearing off my back? That’s envy. Secondly, the dull fish refuse to be friends with the rainbow fish unless he’s willing to give up the scales. That’s a conditional friendship along with peer pressure and is not in alignment with the values I’m trying to teach my child.

Her mom and dad have many books on the shelf for her and I asked about this one. ""We don't know about it"", they said, ""someone gave it as a gift. It's pretty."" It certainly has beautiful illustrations, and I was excited to explore it with her. As I read more and more of the story out loud to her it became apparent to me that Marx and Lenin would be enamored with this book. It was all about how a bunch of bully fish who didn't have the same pretty scales shamed and coerced the rainbow fish to physically sacrifice part of itself for them. There were no positive motivations for doing so. I had hoped partway through the book that it would be a story of the rainbow fish seeing one or more others in some sort of need and feeling compassion toward them, motivated to share its ""wealth"" out of generosity. Instead I got to witness an indoctrination story that could have been straight out of 1930's Russia, one of the pieces Soviet or Chinese ""self-criticism"" propaganda, or the obligatory indoctrination classes for 8 year olds under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In the end I stopped reading the story to her, but created my own tale of love for others and sacrifice from the heart as I turned the pages. It would have been so simple for the authors to do the same, and for that reason I can only assume a bad ulterior motives for trying to place this awful drivel (albeit packaged so beautifully) in the hands and minds of vulnerable and impressionable children.

1558580093,1.0,"punishment rather severe for the ""crime""",12.0,"A beautiful fish is asked by another fish to give him one of his colorful scales. He says no and I was shocked to read that he was ostracized by the other fish for this. Eventually he becomes so lonely that he allows all the fish to strip him of all his scales except for one. It's implied that the Rainbow fish deserves to be friendless because he didn't want to give away his scales--the very thing most special to him. Bullying and social exclusion is a big problem in schools today and experiencing this can leave life long scars. It can even lead to suicide. I'm not saying this book necessarily contributes in any large way to the shunning that goes on in our schools but it has an ominous message. It says that shunning someone for not doing what you want is okay. Children need to be taught acceptance and tolerance--not to use shunning as a tool for getting what they want. Sharing is good--giving up almost everything you have is not. It's not like the fish had two sandwiches and refused to give one to the other fish. The rainbow fish was asked to give up something very special to him. We parents are generally encouraged to tell our children it is okay not to share your lovey or your most favorite toys. We should encourage sharing but it is okay to say no too. A child shouldn't feel under such pressure to say yes every time someone asks him/her for something of theirs. So the vehement reaction to the rainbow fish's ""no"" is way out of line. You should share often and give but it's okay to say no sometimes--especially if you're asked to share something that is very important to you. An alternative ending would be the Rainbow fish finding a school of friendlier fish who admire his scales and enjoy telling him about their own special attributes. Perhaps the Rainbow fish becomes very close to one of the other fish and they become best friends. After knowing each other a long time the Rainbow fish realizes he loves this other fish and gives the other fish one of his scales as a very special gift.

1558580093,1.0,No one has mentioned...,8.0,"One thing that's not mentioned in all the 28 pages of reviews I've read about this book is the unfortunate reality that being nice and generous to other people will not automatically make them your friends. Any way you interpret the analogy - whether the fish scales represent ""giving of yourself"" or giving money, belongings, gifts, kindness, time, or talent - people will not flock around you eager to be friends because you've given them something. It can be disillusioning and disappointing when one grows up and finds this out. For many years I've been a philanthropist, and volunteered my time and caring and finances to help others. I've tried to be nice to everyone - from neighbors to homeless strangers to kids in juvenile hall to coworkers. What I've observed is that it's a rare day indeed that a person gets true friendship in return for sacrificially giving away one's scales. Perhaps a quarter of the time people are grateful and appreciative for what you did (but not interested in starting a friendship). About a quarter of the time your generosity is accepted but you don't get even a personal thank-you in return. (If you're giving to a large organization, you'll get a form letter, and their next request for your donations will have more zeros after the numbers.) About a quarter of the time the person you've given to becomes a sponge who then tries to milk you dry - the only time you ever hear from them is when they want more money from you. They aren't satisfied with getting just one scale, and they get really angry if you ever stop handing over scales to them when they want them. Like the fish in this book, they feel entitled to get whatever you have - it seems right to them that they go through life getting something for nothing. And about a quarter of the time your generosity is coldly or vehemently rejected, or it's taken but you're actively hated for it. I don't know if this is because the receiver is jealous that you have something to give, or they feel you must be looking down on them (even if you aren't). Perhaps they're carrying a chip on their shoulder and are quick to take offense at someone's ""charity"". Maybe they're embarrassed and humiliated that they needed someone's help (even if they asked for the help), and they take out their anger by lashing out at the hand that's feeding them. Maybe they've become cynical and suspicious and are sure that someone being nice to them must have ulterior motives or plans to use or manipulate them. I don't know what their personal problems are. But I do know I've been violently hated by people I knocked myself out trying to be nice to. People do hate others for being different, and they hate you if you have anything they don't - whether that's money, or a clean upright life, or a happy family, or better grades than they have. Trying to befriend people who are excluding you or talking badly about you behind your back is not going to make them your friends, except in the world of fantasy and children's literature. My response to reading this book was to cry - because it's so sad that we go around preaching to our kids, ""If you're just nice to other people and you share with them and don't act rude or stuck up, they'll all like you and want to be your friends,"" when it's simply not true. (Hey, even Jesus - the ideal picture of goodness and generosity, didn't have everyone wanting to be his friend.) Other reviewers of this book have said, ""I think this a great book for children because it teaches them a lesson. The lesson learned is to always share and you'll have many friends."" Or, ""Ultimately, though, children who read this story will interpret on a much simpler level: The Rainbow Fish is mean and greedy, so the other fish stop playing with him. When the fish acts nice and generous, everyone plays with him again."" What do you tell a child who is nice and generous and everyone calls him a ""goodie two shoes"" and doesn't want to play with him? True, no one wants to play with a mean, stuck up, selfish jerk, but no one wants to play with a saint either. The whole premise and message of the book - sharing with others will make them your friends - is wishful thinking. The book's happy ending only works if you read it as a story about conforming to your peer group. Blending in and looking and acting exactly like everyone else might in fact get you accepted into the ""in group"". Maybe generosity is the path to happiness and social acceptance in preschool, but that isn't going to be true by middle school.

Remembering this book as an adult... I THINK this book is trying to say: ""Don't hoard wealth, share your blessings with the community"" as a lesson. But the rainbow fish as a character isn't, like, a greedy CEO who was stealing from the community and denying everyone vital care and fair resources or something like that. He's just...an otherwise-ordinary member of the community who grew different scales. He didn't ASK to be different. The moral appears to be: ""sharing is good."" Sure, okay. But this is a really terrible framing for that otherwise-useful moral. It isn't at all something like, ""Hey, wait, this rainbow fish is somehow taking advantage of our community/ecosystem to GET those scales unfairly"" kind of thing! The scales that he distributes don't ACTUALLY benefit the community in any actual way beyond just satisfying the egos of the other characters. I wish the rainbow fish was sharing something like toys, and maybe learns that some toys are more fun with a group? That could be a better way to frame this ""sharing is good"" lesson. But as-is, honestly...how dare the other fish in the story be like ""hey, rainbow fish, give me access to your body because I'm jealous of you."" And how dare this book frame that as a good thing, a happy ending! Kids deserve to set boundaries ESPECIALLY with their bodies and their appearances and this book tramples all over that.

So Random Kid gets angry, tells your kid they’re a horrible person, that they should learn to share that beautiful hair, and then proceeds to tell all the other kids at the playground about how selfish your kid is.

Basically, all the other fish are jealous of Rainbow Fish's beautiful shiny scales. So they pout and won't be his friend.

The one redeeming theme is that we shouldn't brag about the talents or things we have. However, this is overshadowed by catering to those who are jealous and those who are only your friend because of what you can do for them. Instead of teaching kids to be thankful for their gifts and find a way to use them to help others, it taught my son that he needs to make sure everyone is equal and no one can have anything extra. Terrible. I want my kids to take pride in their work and talents, and temper that with a generous attitude.

1558580093,1.0,Beware of over-hyped children's books,258.0,"This book is very pretty. I've read it to a group of children (not my choice - a teacher asked me to do so) and to my own child, who got it out of the library, and I've certainly seen its appeal to young children. They can't sit still. They just have to reach out and touch the lovely, shiny, foil scales. (Although the look of disappointment on their faces when they find out it's just a flat surface is also obvious.) I think getting children interested in books at a young age is crucial, so ordinarily I would love a book with this kind of appeal, even if it wasn't a book that especially appealed to me. I perfectly understand that sometimes children and adults have different tastes. But this book, despite its prettiness, is awful. A beautiful fish, different from all the other fish because of his glittering, jewel-colored scales, has a hard time making friends, because the other fish don't like the fact that he does not look like them. In order to win friends, he gives away his scales, one by one, until all the fish in the ocean look alike. I understand that the book is supposed to be about sharing, but giving away everything you have isn't sharing, it's buying friends. That's something many young children are already prone to do, and it's not something any caring parent or teacher would want to encourage. The book's success also bothers me because it is a blatant rip-off of a much better book - Leo Lionni's classic Tico and the Golden Wings. In Lionni's book, a bird gives away the golden feathers of its wings. But the tone of the book is very different. Lionni's bird is born without wings, unable to fly. He wishes for wings, and is granted golden ones. As he flies around the world, he sees people living lives of great hardship and he gives each person one of his golden feathers in order to help them. Each time he gives away a golden feather, a real one grows in its place. In the end, his bird friends see him with his black wings and tell him that now he's just like them. But Tico realizes that although he looks like them, he is different inside. Unlike The Rainbow Fish, Tico and the Golden Wings teaches children to be generous AND to be themselves. It doesn't make it seem like it's impossible to be a unique individual and still get along with others.",FALSE,children

Caution spoilers: There is a pretty fish all the other fish call rainbow fish. They admire his beauty but rainbow fish doesn't want to play with them. So rainbow fish is minding his own business when another little fish swims up to him and says please give me one of your scales ""you have so many""(!!!). Rainbow fish says no so the little fish goes to the other fish and they all decide they won't play with him because he won't share his scales. That for some reason makes Rainbow fish sad even though before he didn't want to play with them anyway. A clam tells rainbow fish to go see a ""wise"" octopus who proceeds to tell him that he will never be happy unless he gives all of his scales away. Rainbow fish then gives each fish one pretty scale until all the fish each have one pretty scale and no fish is prettier than any other fish at which point the other fish decide they now can be his friend. So the lesson is that everyone should look alike and if you have something better than someone else you should give it away? It bothers me that he doesn't share because it makes the other fish feel good or because the fish are in need of scales to survive but just so the other fish will like him and no one is different. It also bothers me that the other fish feel entitled to rainbow fish's scales for some reason. I have put this book in my compost bin(the best use for this rubbish in my opinion) and used it to explain to my children that if someone only likes you because they want your things then that is not a friend worth having, just because someone doesn't look like you doesn't mean you should not like them, and that it is ""ok"" to not want to play with someone if you are polite and respectful of their feelings.",FALSE,children

Ask your children’s librarian. This book, however, I fear would send the wrong message to children about how they are valued and what others can ask of them. Sure, the rainbow fish is kind of a jerk when one of the fish asks for a shiny scale. He could have just said no without the personal insult (“who do you think you are?” and acting superior because he’s pretty). But I agree with others saying the fish was violated, guilted into allowing consent to his body (which is not true consent). I feel like it’s just a stone’s throw from “I bought you dinner so now you owe me sex.” Basically, what the rainbow fish is told is: 1. You have to share your body with people even if you don’t want to, because saying no makes you selfish. 2. Being beautiful (having a shiny scale from the rainbow fish) is SO IMPORTANT that it’s ok to violate someone else, because beauty is what makes you valuable & being more beautiful will make you happier. I totally get that the reason the other fish don’t want to be friends with the rainbow fish is because he was kinda mean when asked to share, but he was asked to give up a part of his body for the sake of their own vanity and self esteem. That’s not ok. Did anyone want to be friends with the rainbow fish just because he was cool, or did they even try to get to know him? No, we don’t get that story.

Yes, the rainbow fish had a crummy attitude with its arrogance about its beauty, but instead of being humbled, reforming his attitude, and finding friends who like him for who he is, the rainbow fish seems to be told by the wise octopus that the only way he would ever get friends and have others like him was to befriend the very mean and rude fish that kept asking him to give them his shiny scales. Like, what kind of a lesson are we trying to teach our kids? That relationships are transactional and that the only true way to get people to like you is to give them nice things? This is the very opposite lesson I am trying to teach my son. The lesson could have been easily been modified by instead of the fish he befriended having previously asked for his scales, maybe have a fish who was badly injured and needed some scales donated, and he felt good for helping a fish in need and others responded positively to his selflessness, or maybe there could have been some fish who were poor and the shiny scales helped them get some food.

Buy this book if you want your child to learn how to buy friends...friends who are greedy and selfish. Friends who can be bought are the best kind of friends you can have. If you don't give away your possessions, you are greedy. You are a conceited, self-absorbed bastard with no friends unless you give away your beauty. Perhaps you should consider disfiguring yourself to make yourself unattractive...that surely will attract new friends! Buy this book if you are transgender and want your child to read about the female octopus with a deep voice. Perhaps this was changed in translation to make it more politically correct. It just adds to the confusion that is this book. There are so many good children's books that don't have a confusing message or political undertones. Those that like this book and give it high ratings often state that Rainbow Fish was vain and lonely and unhappy and that he learned to share and that real beauty is on the inside... However, after reading all the reviews, I went back and slowly and carefully read the book a few more times. At first, the other fish were amazed at his beauty and would beg him to play with them.

1558580093,1.0,"Almost a great story about kindness. Instead, an insidious reimagining of the Communist Manifesto.",4.0,"While the authors present the idea they are trying to pass off as a simple lesson about generosity, it actually is quite insidious and disturbing once you scratch the surface of the metaphor. In normal cases, one regards kindness to be the giving of what one has in abundance to others who are less fortunate. If it were that simple it would be fine. But one small distinction makes the idea expressed in this book very much NOT about simple generosity at all. If I were a fish with an abundance of scales, and I had friends with no scales, then the concept of generosity would be properly expressed as giving others something you have more of, that you don't need yourself, and fulfilling a need. No one, however, needs the rainbow fish's scales in this book. They are just jealous, and the rainbow fish acts as if his scales make him better than others. In response to this problematic behavior, the other creatures of the sea actually actually acquiesce to the rainbow fish's sense of privilege, which is quite odd, and they begin to want the fish's scales for themselves. They don't need the rainbow fish's scales. They just *want* them, and only because the rainbow fish hold it over their heads. This should have been a book about the rainbow fish learning about the advantages and disadvantages that other creatures have, and how in some contexts having shiny scales is not good. In fact, the fish learns in the animated video of this book that having shiny scales actually prevents him from being able to hide from predators. But instead of going in an appropriate direction, the book takes a turn. Instead, it presents the notion that, in order to treat the rainbow fish's sense of privilege, the fish should alter its appearance in the form of giving its scales away. Again, no one needs the fish's scales. They just want them, and only because they've coopted the rainbow fish's toxic thinking. So apparently, once the rainbow fish gives away all but one of its scales, every one is now happy and accepting of the rainbow fish and its toxic ideology is resolved. This is another problem with the book. If this were a book about literally anything else of consequence, and that is where in real life these social issues arise, it would be easy to understand how dangerous the metaphor is, but making it about a fish in a children's book seems to be an attempt at passing off the book's thinly veiled attempt at validating communist ideology by framing it in the verbiage of generosity and equality, which is a very common practice. The idea is that everyone will be happy and free and accepting once the fish gives away its born traits, the particular traits that make the fish unique and special, also these traits are in the real world as necessary to the fish's survival as the lobster's claws, as fish, and other animals with brightly colored skin or scales are an evolutionary signal to predators to stay away, that they are poisonous. Knowing this makes the book even more disturbing to informed readers, as it may seem to be suggesting one should sacrifice one's unique traits, even to the extent of placing one's self in very real danger, in order to satisfy the abritrary social misgivings of others. Granted, this is a book for children, and one must look at it through a child's eyes. Children, however, will invariably recieve the message that whatever makes a person special is bad, and they should give it away if it makes others feel bad. If I am white, and others don't like it, I should endeavor to become less white to satisfy their feelings that I am somehow now responsible for. Enabling these misgivings by giving away my uniqueness, should make everyone better because they are now more white, and I am less white, and that sshould cause me to be more thoughtful and respectful about how others are different, and they should become less jealous of me. In effect, the book actually takes the valued ideal of equality to the dangerous extreme that Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron warned us about long ago. What's even more terrifying is that in our current day and age, this is apparently something many people actually embrace. No one should ever think that devaluing yourself for the arbitrary satisfaction of the jealousy of others is some twisted act of kindness. No one needs the acceptance of jealous people and shouldn't want it, any more than they should have to think being proud of who they are is somehow wrong, OR that enabling others' jealousy will make them like you, OR think that what makes me special gives me the right to mistreat others. This book is about as psychologically damaging as you can get to children's minds. There are lots of books that show children kindness in healthy ways. What this book shows children is that being special or different makes you a bad person, that you should hurt yourself so others will like you, and that kindness and respect for diversity are somehow at odds. In so doing, its metaphor mischaracterizes both diversity and kindness. I don't believe in banning books, but if I did I would ban this one. Everyone has a voice, however, but that does not mean everyone's ideas are good or healthy. So that's why I simply encourage parents to understand what this book is really about and if anything, use the book to encourage your children to think about what kindness should really mean. It certainly doesn't mean changing who you are as a person, or having to alter your born traits just to fit in. If others don't accept you, or think you owe them something just because you're different, it's them that needs to learn something.",FALSE,children

Everyone doesn’t need the exact same bings to be happy. It’s basically communist indoctrination. If all the fish have an equal number of scales then everyone will be happy and get along... bull crap... this book is going in the trash. I do believe Kids should play fair and share but if a kid doesn’t want to give away something that is prized to him he shouldn’t be ostracized for it, a kid shouldn’t have to give away their possessions to get friends. This “you have to give people what they want” mentality is dangerous. Worst case scenario, it can be used to teach kids to allow Horrible abuse to continue, bc you want to be liked, don’t you so you have to give people what they want... no way, my kid won’t be taught to be used and be a doormat.

Fabio's peers covet his naturally endowed gifts, which were assigned to him through forces beyond his control, ie.; gifts from the Creator and/or simply good genes. This confuses Fabio, ""why does everyone want retribution from me in exchange for acceptance""? Fabio thinks, ""they wish rip my body parts from me, literally the skin of my body, and surgically implant my corporeal gifts onto their lackluster bodies."" Fabio goes for advice from spineless blobs of ""wisdom."" These invertebrate losers suggest that Fabio allow these jealous weaklings to tear his physical gifts from his body, bestowed upon him through no effort of his own, and subsequently surgically implant them on their weak genetic specimens so that they will accept him and be his ""friend."" Fabio agrees to the mutilation because he craves the ""friendship"" of lesser individuals who are jealous of his God-given gifts, according to Pfister. Apparently, Fabio thinks to himself, NOW, I am the happiest person in the world now that I have mutilated myself so that these covetous losers can have a piece of my essence surgically grafted upon their bodies. ""Good thing I have friends like these around,"" thinks Fabio as he comes to terms with the fact that he was literally martyred for just being himself to make jealous people happy. The End."" Is that the kind of lesson you want to be burned indelibly into your beautiful child's subconsciousness? It's bad enough the propaganda that the lesser individuals in our post-modern society indoctrinate into our children in the public schools that lead to the guilt complexes that drive people to socialism, and then you'll give your beautiful child a double-dose of the rot at home?

Instead of echoing what many of the 1-star reviewers have said (most of which I agree with about the “sharing”) I’ll address the other problems I had with this book. We meet Rainbow Fish ignoring and gliding past the other fish who invite him to play. He overreacts when asked for a scale. Whines about not being admired by his fellow fish. There’s so much wrong with this. Rainbow Fish is a snob but wonders why he’s “the loneliest fish in the entire ocean.” He was given the opportunity to have friends, but he was too “proud and silent” to accept their invitation and just swam past them. Also, we get it, Rainbow Fish shouldn’t need to give his scales away to be accepted. However, his reaction to the little blue fish who first asked for a scale was aggressive. A simple “No,” would have been fine. That’s why you had no friends, Rainbow Fish! You yelled at the little blue fish, told him to “Get away,” so of course he was going to tell the other fish how rude you were. No one wants to play with you or admire you because you were rude.

Those are your scales, some rando isn't entitled to any of them!"", but then to my dismay and shock, I saw where they were going with this. It's horrible and ridiculous that this poor, unique, beautiful fish gets ostracized and vilified because he/she doesn't want to give up essential parts of their being just to please others and make friends. This doesn't teach sharing, it teaches that you have to be a people-pleaser to ever make friends and that if you don't make unfair sacrifices, no one will like you. Basically you have to compromise yourself and bribe people to like you. Ummmm, what?!?!?!

Terrible, terrible lesson that I can't believe is so popular and has so many 4-star reviews. Please, for your child's sake or any other child, don't read this or gift this to anyone.

Like others have already noted, the message in this story is horrible as written. That message being that everyone should be the same and that you should give something that you hold dear to others simply because they want you to. That is the exact opposite of what I want my son to learn. I want him to revel in his uniqueness and have no fear of being proud of things that others may jealously tear him apart for (modesty is good, but recognizing ways that your special is also good!). I do not want him to ever feel like he needs to give in to the demands of others. And I want him to share because he WANTS to share and not because he fears repercussions. In fact, someone who feels entitled to something he has is someone who doesn't deserve it. So, since I have this book and honestly don't even want to gift it to someone else, I tell my own story using the illustrations. When the little fish gets angry that the Rainbow Fish won't give him a scale, my version is that it makes the Rainbow Fish sad and he doesn't understand why the little fish and all the other fish are being so mean to him. He seeks out the starfish and then the octopus (squid?), who tells him that sometimes people react poorly when they see that someone else has something they want and that Rainbow Fish should explore the ocean for fish who will be nicer to him. RF does this and finds a friend who admires his shiny scales and invites RF to play with his friends. The friends all have single scales and don't make demands of him and RF is no longer lonely. I don't really acknowledge how RF only has one shiny scale at the end, though I'll probably just say that he offered some of his scales to some of the other fish if it comes up. (BY CHOICE, not pressure!). Obviously, this isn't a perfect rewrite... I'd prefer the fish at the end be varied and not all fish with a shiny scale, but that's not what's drawn.

So then he decides ok I'll give up all my scales if you'll be my friends. So he does and they become friends. This is not ok. Sharing is good, and I'm sure this was meant to be the moral of the story. But conditional friendship is not ok, and these are not pebbles he's sharing, they are literally a part of himself.

This is not a story about sharing possessions or toys with others who are needy, but sharing one’s body without consent because one is pressured to do so against one’s gut feeling of what is right. I don’t think I’m being dramatic when I say this book teaches children to give up a special part of themselves when pressured to do so... at best this book encourages people-pleasing behavior in children, and at worst molestation.

First, what was the PP committee thinking? Yes it was 1961, yes it was the Civil Rights Movement, yes a lot of people used WAY too much pot, but none of those arguments can explain why this obvious, saccharine mockery of a novel won anything, including publication rights.

60935464,1.0,The Most Boring Book on Earth,5.0,"I read this book today at the age of forty because I wanted to understand of why my childhood mind disenjoyed it. And truly, it felt like walking through quicksand as I slowly battled through every boring word. How on Earth did To Kill A Mockingbird win a Pulitzer Prize? To answer that question would be a waste of time because the world knows that wokeness is typically rewarded as brilliance. And yes the book paints an exquisite portrait of the reality of racism as it existed in the 1930s. And yes the book paints an exquisite portrait of the main character named Atticus Finch. He is truly an honourable man with the highest quality combination of brain and heart. And those elements alone are appealing to the woke and to those who are correct like myself. But the story was honestly written for the enjoyment of an elementary school-aged boy and for nobody else. It very much reminds me of The Sandlot, a movie about little boys and The Great Bambino.

60935464,1.0,Incomprehensible,3.0,"To Kill a Mockingbird is widely regarded as a masterpiece of American literature. There's just one problem: Nobody who liked it actually read the damn thing. They watched the movie instead. My most important requirement for a novel: it must be entertaining. TKAM is by far the LEAST entertaining 20th century novel that I have read. The characters are flat, far too numerous, and difficult to differentiate. The dialogue is unintelligible. The narrative is muddled by numerous unnecessary subplots. The prose is weighted down by excessive exposition and description. Lee's halfhearted attempts at symbolism are childish, superficial, and silly. The biggest problem is the point-of-view character, a six-year-old girl named Scout. Her limited perspective turns a hard-to-follow plot into a truly incomprehensible one. Characters that should have easily identifiable motivations are instead baffling. It seems to me that this book is nothing more than a collection of subplots. In fact, I'd say that it would have been better if Lee had realized this and turned this into an anthology of short stories instead of trying to clumsily weave them into a full-fledged novel. I am truly dumbfounded not only at the difficulty of cracking the plot, but also at how this came to be considered a classic. Heck, I've seen Harry Potter fan fiction that's better than this. I have read this novel 3 times. Once in grade 8, once in my sophmore year of high school, and once in college. Each time I hoped that it would be better than the last time around. Each time I hope that the version I had been force-fed before was just a cruel joke, and entirely different from the one that became a ""classic."" But it's not. There is no better printed version of this story anywhere. This is a real shame because it had so much potential, yet it SUCKS BALLZ! Perhaps the best part of TKAM is its legacy. I have seen the 1962 film with Gregory Peck, and it was solid. It shows that a decent movie CAN be made out of mediocre source material, provided that the screenwriter charged with reading and adapting it can finish it without going completely nutz.",FALSE,children

This is not printed, but photo copied on cheap recycled craft paper. This is obviously a counterfeit foreign printed book.

I actually went to the book store just to verify and the same book at the book store looks exactly the same except the quality is top notch. This is directly from Amazon Prime, so obviously Amazon is now in the business of purchasing counterfeits and selling them at premium price. As far as the story, it is a classic. Classic artist with a complex story that is superbly delivered. They just don't write books like this anymore. Authors these days are more concerned about getting a best seller than writing a quality story that will still be selling 50 years from now. Harper Lee's books will still sell when I am long gone. Again, the story is a 5 star. Bottom line: Great story and author, really poor publishing. Too bad the book quality means this hard back will only be around for a few years before it comes apart or the pages deteriorate.

You may not be sensitized to black men assaulting white women which is a million times more common, but we should only be ready for exceptions to the rule rather than the rule itself. That makes us more enlightened. This book is partly responsible for reinforcing the anti-white bias that prevails in the media as we are constantly bombarded with stories of black victims and white perpetrators despite the fact that blacks are a 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a White than vice versa. Good blacks shouldn't suffer because of the stereotypes that many of their racial kinsmen reinforce, but whites shouldn't be stigmatized when they coalesce on racial lines either because it's not always for bad reasons as in To Kill A Mockingbird. Because TKaM is never balanced out in school reading lists with books about black on white crime or books favorable to whites organizing along racial lines, the promulgation of TKaM is a half truth that amounts to a deception.

60935464,1.0,"The back story behind ""To Kill a Mockingbird""",1.0,"I'm questioning WHO really made ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" the best-selling book it turned out to be? It's no secret that the original title was ""Go Set a Watchman"" and that Harper Lee had submitted her manuscript to ten different publishers who all turned it down. Then a small publisher in Pennsylvania agreed to publish it - but it assigned the manuscript to one of their editors who worked with Harper Lee for TWO YEARS to re-write the manuscript and turn it into a readable book that told a story of a young girl growing up in a small town in Alabama and some of the happenings in that small town. The editor suggested the story be told through the eyes of a young girl named ""Scout"" and gave the manuscript a new title ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The stories told in the book are NOT ""fiction"". They're Harper Lee's account of a things that happened in the small Alabama town where she grew up, including her father's controversial decision to defend a black man who had been accused of raping a white girl. When the manuscript of the second book also named ""Go Set a Watchman"" came out, I read it and it was terrible, kind of a series of musings and more like a journal than a book telling a story, and certainly not a novel. This got me pondering. Was Harper Lee's second book to be published ""Go Set a Watchman"" a sample of her REAL writing style - and is this why her first manuscript had been rejected by ten different publishers before she found one who would publish it - but it was more or less completely re-written by an editor working with Harper Lee and also re-titled? What if this editor had not worked on the book for two years with Harper Lee? Would it ever have been published and become the phenomenon and best-selling novel that it ultimately became? Has anyone ever seen Harper Lee's ORIGINAL manuscript for the book that became ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? If it's still around it would be very interesting to learn WHO really made this book the best seller that it turned out to be - Harper Lee OR the editor who worked with her for TWO YEARS to re-write the original manuscript and tell the story through the eyes of the young girl and to change the title to ""To Kill a Mockingbird""?",FALSE,children

Aside from the fact it's written as a script, it smacks as if the agent said to the author ""Hey, can you bang out a sequel over the weekend, so we can get something to publishing next Tuesday?"" Much like when a stand in takes up the torch to continue or finish an established franchise (e.g., Mitch Rapp, Jack Ryan, Star Wars movies 1-3), the finished product lacks continuity, polish, and elegance. This is not an adventure or mystery, like the original books. There is very little (practically zero) magic (ideal for a live stage production). A couple of potions, a few unlock spells. Certainly nothing 'new' to indicate the wizarding world advanced anything in two decades since Hallows. This is a morality play about forgiveness and redemption, coming of age and parents relating to their children; it could have been set in any small town in any time period, with normal people, and it would sell about 20,000 copies. Since it's recycling established, endearing characters it is going to be commercially successful. But it left this dedicated fan disappointed and feeling a bit swindled.",TRUE,children

I truly wonder how involved JK Rowling was in the writing of this script, because if her name weren't on the front cover I'd say she wasn't involved at all. The characters are just wrong. Original characters personalities are a miss, new characters are inconsequential, overall, I wish I had just left Harry Potter be done, and hadn't bothered reading this. If you are on the fence at all about whether to read this book, just leave it be. Allow the memory of Harry Potter to remain unblemished.",TRUE,children

I didn't think I'd mind the script format, but it's super sparse with very little to guide you. Found it hard to picture the setting or hear the character's tone of voice. Part of the pleasure in reading are the way words come together to paint a picture, and this lacks that completely. Just step-by-step dialogue.

I'm very disappointed and a little angry with Rowling for attaching her name to this, or approving it at all. At no point do the characters even SPEAK like themselves, much less act the way they would. It's incredibly obvious it's basically a fanfiction by Thorne, and should in no way be associated with the Harry Potter Series.

Unfortunately, the rest of the script is quite disappointing. The characters are superficial and always act exactly as you expect. The plot is ridicilous, implausible and yet without any surprises whatsoever. The dialogue reads like a speech by Donald Trump: It tells you in black and white what the world is like, and how you should feel about it; there are no nuances, no room for interpretation.

133821666X,2.0,"If this were an O.W.L. exam, it would rate a D (dreadful).",5,"This reads like fan fiction ... and not even good fan fiction. I am an avid HP fan -- I gladly plunked down my hard-earned cash for the hardback book each time a new novel was released. I own all of the books in hardback, Kindle and CD (Jim Dale ROCKS!) and all of the additional books, as well as all of the movies. And I watch, read and listen to them regularly. It isn't just about the simple story line. It was about the symbolism, the mythology, the nuances, the multiple threads, the details that spanned the books from beginning to end and an impoverished single mum who pulled herself out of poverty by her pen. Suffice it to say, I know this story forwards and backwards. This? Well, I preordered it and didn't have huge expectations (but certainly higher than Snape's expectations of liking Harry). It's a good thing I kept them low, because the end product certainly failed to impress. I can only imagine the disappointment of those who were as excited to get it as Dobby is when he gets Christmas socks from Harry. As a writer, I have done my fair share of ghostwriting. This feels like a clunky ghostwritten project. JKR may have created the story, which has the potential to be brilliant in novel form. But, the playwrights let it fall flatter than the golden chair Hagrid broke at the wedding in book 7. I read it as one should read a play -- imagining staging, timing, costuming, lighting, etc. The story is incredibly linear (which kind of makes sense given how the story plays with time). The characters are wooden (even the Golden Trio come across as droll). I wondered more than once if there was a LGBT agenda woven into the character development of the two young protagonists (a nod to the Dumbledore-Grindelwald relationship perhaps?). Connections are dropped left and right. Seriously, the storyline feels like a leaky cauldron -- details and continuity are leaking out everywhere. Meanwhile, the first scenes are very fast and disjointed, which I understand if you want to quickly portray the passage of time, but unless the staging is amazing, I doubt anyone but avid fans will understand what's going on. I will say this -- if they are able to pull off the ""magic"" on stage, that would be very, very cool to see. This is not a stand-alone work of fiction. If you aren't familiar with the characters and also Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, you're going to be lost. I hope this is released in novel form ... and that JKR plays a much bigger role in its creation and editing. Several friends have asked if I'll read this play again. Maybe ... if I have three hours to waste. Will I see the plays? Likely, but I'll likely wait until the production comes to the United States. While I love visiting London (and the HP studios and Platform 9 3/4), this isn't worth a dedicated trip across the Pond. Would I watch it in a movie form? Yes, but like I said, I'm an avid fan ... and I can only hope that the novel and movie versions, if they are created, will be better than this iteration.

Written by men. Duh. And then there are all the opportunities to tie up any loose ends over characters we lost and mourned in the book. I prefer my own imagination to fill in those stories. I could go on, but let's talk about the book. The printing is awful. Some pages are so faint it's hard to read them. Paper feels like newsprint. And there are ink smears across many pages. At least it was cheap. Why did I even give it two stars!!! At least I have a Broadway play to see and I hear the staging and effects are great and I'm going with one of my best friends.

I knew that this was going to be written in play form, so that wasn't a surprising letdown. When the book finally came after a grueling four month wait, I started as soon as I could. As big a Potterhead as I am, I was disappointed. The characters weren't quite the same, the trolley witch turned out to be peculiar in a non-Potteresque way, and it was confusing and a bit hard to follow. The only thing that I thought made it worth reading was Scorpius Malfoy. He was wonderful, even though I'm not a fan of Draco.

So who fought Voldemort at the end all by himself because ""that was the way it had to be?"" Who was in the Chamber of Secrets fighting the basilisk? Who went on and saved the Sorcerer's Stone?). Dumbledore's portrait? That was a horrible portrayal. I could go on . . . but when I re-read the series again and again, I'll surely leave this little piece out.

There is a lot here that is funny, cute, and interesting, but calling this play canon makes the original Harry Potter series look like a joke by association. I feel like this would be better received if it were presented a dramatic interpretation of Harry Potter (à la 'A Very Potter Musical' but less comical) rather than ""the eighth story."" The good: Scorpius is adorable. I love the way that Ron and Hermione's relationship is portrayed There is a lot of interesting commentary on ""what might have been"" if small details in history were changed. It is often quite funny. Not relevant to the book, but the acting and special effects in the production in London are supposed to be amazing, so if they released a recorded version I would probably shell out more money for it, despite my disappointment with the book. The bad: The plot is bizarre and fanfiction-y in multiple ways. If you've had any contact with HP fanfiction you will easily recognize several tropes that seem bizarrely out-of-place in a real Harry Potter story. There are multiple plot holes (mostly small, some rather major) and inconsistencies that call into doubt all of the detail and planning that went into the HP universe of the original series. Rather than taking the opportunity to expand upon the post-war Wizarding World and show us how the world developed in the past twenty years, the play focuses mostly on revisiting characters and events from the original series. Some characters that I was looking forward to learning more about, such as Teddy Lupin, where completely left out of the story. Instead, we get to see Snape, Dumbledore, Cedric, and even Harry's parents, which is nice except that I already got well acquainted with those characters in the original series and was looking forward to something new. Basically, I think this play is written to give a nice emotional high to those who are still sentimental for the original series, but anyone who was looking for a new story or expansion of the universe will be disappointed. On a brighter note, the trailers for Fantastic Beasts look amazing, so at least we still have that to look forward to! :)",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,I am pretty heartbroken like everyone else,6,"I should be so lucky that my flight is delayed by 4 hours and I'm stuck at the airport, giving me plenty of time to read this script. First of all, let me preface with my own admission that I know this is the wromg medium for consuming the story. This was written for a play, and one will not absorb the entire story simply by reading the script once through. I have not seen the play. I will not be able to grasp the nuances of the detail and deep emotions JK Rowling was able to deliver in her book. To fully appreciate the story, you should watch the play and/ or study the script properly. I have not done that, but I am also not holding it against this format by giving a lower rating due to this. No, I am simply rating based on the story. BTW, yes I am a big time Harry Potter fan. Have been since the very beginning like most of you. The wizarding world of Harry Potter is very special to me, and this breaks my heart a little. Spoilers from here on: I think calling it a cheap fan fic is a little harsh, there was some good and some bad... mostly bad. I do not like the fact that Ron seems like a former shell of himself. The book makes it seem like Harry did everything, and glosses over what Hermione and Ron and everyone else did. Ron and Hermoine's daughter seems like a shallow brat, she doesn't even like Scorpius/ Albus until after they have done something heroic. She seems obsessed with status, the opposite of what Ron and Hermione would have raised their daughter to be. The part about the polyjuive potion was absurd. How does the Ministry not have detection mechanisms for that after what Harry, Ron and Hermione pulled in The Deathly Hallows? I mean, yes... Voldermort having a child makes me want to kick a duck, but everyone's already mentioned that so I won't hammer it again. But I will say that Voldemort having a child is the least favorite part of the whole thing. Albus and Scorpius's friendship was great, it mirrored the relationship that Harry and Ron's, in that they were both outcasts. Harry felt like he could never fill the shoes that everyone gave him, and so does Albus. I like that parallel. I like the depth that they have given Draco- he gets more of a backstory and his personality doesn't become too compromised to fit the plot. In fact, Draco's story was well done. I'm OK with the time turner story despite it's flaws... I just don't like how they butchered a lot of the integrity of the characters. Back to things I don't like again, as I've just said everything that I do like. I'm bouncing all over the place here.. OK. I hate the fact that they never explain about the broken arm situation after the first time turner trip. I hate that they've left out so manu key characters- the surviving Weasleys, Luna, Neville, Hagrid?!! None of this is OK! What is Luna doing these days? I need to know these things. The fight scene- if Harry was weakened by the scar and therefore was struggling against Delphi, I could see that. But no, they made a point to tell us how strong she was. Harry beat Voldemort in a duel! Harry is supposed to be really good at Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry is older now and presumably got good training from the Ministry and must have evolved. The whole spiel about how Delphi studied Harry just seems.... contrived. Finally, Snape's character was butchered. The whole thing with Snape seemed very forced just to make the plot happened. It didn't feel like Snape at all, I don't see him saying those things about Albus/ Harry. It seemed so out of character, I was so mad because Snape is one of my favs. If you are a Harry Potter fan, I'd still say read it. Form your own opinions because everyone took away such different experiences from their Harry Potter journeys. This is simply what I took away from this script.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,An Ill Conceived Disappointment,5,"Perhaps it is only the weight of the legacy dumped upon this poor play that makes it disappointing. It was instantly clear that Rowling was barely involved in the writing. Nevertheless, this play feels like a novel hastily converted. Driven by plot, it moves like a roller coaster, so fast that the scenery becomes a blur. Only the most crucial details are stated, much, including a great deal of character development, happens off stage. Without the luxury of exploring an intricate story over 800 pages, with time to develop characters slowly, set up meetings in advance, and gradually weave a plot together, the writing becomes far too urgent. So often I felt that the play needed to sit, to breathe, to flesh out conflicts and feelings. Frequently was the scene quickly set for such a thing, and just as quickly ripped down for the next piece of fast paced action. The plot, already incredibly convoluted, drives the dialogue at breakneck pace. it is impossible to truly explore the impact of words on the characters because to move the plot forward everyone must be on the same page at the same time. No misunderstandings. No localized conflict. Instead one is presented with essentially three teams, driving scavenger hunt style through a murky maze. The dialogue, the centerpiece of any play, the real reason to drag oneself out of his home to the theatre to see real people pouring their hearts out to one another, their pain, their joy, their hopes all bared before the world, is related instead to servant of the ruthless plot. Like a train conductor it has a timetable, a route, and no time to wait for conversations before it moves out. This is not to say the plot has intrinsic problems, but that it is unsuited to a play. Like a turbocharged engine dropped into a scooter, a sedate ride through the countryside, with time to meander and see, becomes a high speed chase, where to take ones eyes of the road would be catastrophic. Nonetheless, I'm sure all harry potter fans will read this, and they should, if only to stay up to date. They should also brace themselves for high speed confusion and moderate disappointment.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Not great... just not great at all...,,"I appreciate their effort, but it lacks the original voice of the books. I read this script not expecting anything but hopeful to be woefully delighted in the resurgence of key characters. What I didn't expect was another Harry Potter Greatest Hits (which book 7 already covered much more successfully).In fact, the characters don't even speak or act anything similar to the written characters. The time traveling is merely spackle for lack of content and/or a bandaid to piece together what seems to be vignettes of what (I am sure) JK Rowling has written in her notebooks. I have read good stage scripts. This is not one of them. I'm going to reread the books now to get the bad taste out of my mouth. P.S.

My hunger for more Harry Potter Sagas blinded my logic and now I'm here writting a bad review about the book "" that should not be named"". How on earth this book got published? Harry potter saga books are well written, with an engaging plot and characters. This book could have had so much potential if it was written by JK Rowling. But it was not the case. The characters are nothing like the original ones. Sound different, act different and just doesn't make any sense. The only interesting thing about this book is the relationship between the two kids. Maybe the writers had a good idea but the execution of the book is poorly. Sorry.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Oh so dissapointed.,1,Spoilers! You can tell it was not written by J.K. Rowling. Harry is a very different father than the one we saw sending his sons off to Hogwarts. In this version he is uncomfortable in the role of father and has a hard time relating to his son. A sweet little old witch is turned into a demon truant officer and there is a very unlikely offspring as the new villain. I looked forward to reading this and really tried to like it but could not. There was so much time travel and alternate universes that I thought I must be reading a Dr. Who sci-fi rather than a Rowling Hogwarts fantasy.

133821666X,2.0,Don't Make This Your First Impression of Harry Potter!,,"I have a few things I really didn't like about this script and I will try not to spoil anything for those who have not yet read it. My biggest negative after reading this as a Harry Potter fan was that the dialogue of the returning Harry Potter characters (Harry, Hermoine, Ron, etc.) felt very unnatural to the characters from the original series. I understand that Harry is now in his late 30s, early 40s in this play but there were times when I was reading his lines, and other returning characters' lines, where it just felt like that isn't something that character would say. There was also some dialogue that was really ""cheesy"" and felt like the writer was trying to force a laugh which made the line seem unnatural. It is also missing the descriptive quality that made the original series so good, I understand it's a play and that quality would be lacking a bit but it was almost entirely absent in the scene descriptions. The story line was pretty predictable (even the ""twist"" at the end was predictable) and was used much more effectively in other movies that had used it before. I hope this review helps and I didn't spoil anything. I think any Harry Potter fan will check this out regardless of the reviews, as I did. But, if you're new to the Harry Potter series please read the original series and don't make this your first impression of Harry Potter.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,This script made me believe in buying paper books again...,2,"Since the advent of Kindle, I've rarely bought paper books any more. Digital books are easier to store and a lot of time they're cheaper too. When Harry Potter and the Cursed Child came out, I thought about getting a hard copy...I love the Harry Potter series and what better way to celebrate the new story than to buy a book that I can display on my shelf? But old habits die hard and I got the ebook instead. Halfway through the Cursed Child, I became terrified that Rowling would release a new edition of the Deathly Hallows (my favorite in the series and one of my all-time favorite books ever). Being a Star Wars fan as well as a Harry Potter fan, I'm well aware of the tendency to change the older, more beloved stories to fit the ""new stuff"" instead of taking care to make sure the new stuff doesn't contradict the real story--and I don't want my Deathly Hallows changed, thank you very much. It's Harry and not Ginny who tells Albus that ""He likes a laugh, your brother"". I know kindle periodically sends out updates to books and what if one day I accidentally hit a button and my Deathly Hallows gets ""updated""? What if Harry isn't a good father in my epilogue anymore? Having worked myself up into a complete panic, I hurried to Amazon and bought myself a paper copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There. Now the story will always end like it's supposed to: Harry's a great dad and his scar doesn't hurt. You'll have to break into my house and vandalize my beloved book before that changes. In the interest of fairness, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the character of Scorpious Malfoy and had the play followed his schooldays' adventures with Albus Potter, I would have willingly purchased a paper copy of that story...instead of whatever it was the play actually was. It wasn't just that I didn't like how much it changed things and characters, the script just really didn't hold my attention. I kept drifting off while reading (and I used to read Shakespeare's play scripts as a child, so it wasn't the format that bored me). It just...wasn't good and wasn't Harry Potter.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,"Spoiler-Free Opinion: Legacy-affecting, unnecessary addition to HP Universe",16,"Book 7 of HP put such a final, satisfying conclusion on such a long winding story and I feel the new play might damage the whole HP experience for new readers. The play is a fanfic glossing of characters, events and objects that lovers of the series may go gaga over but add little value to the literary legacy it follows, often breaking against predetermined rules, boundaries and personality traits that were meticulously set up in the original 7 books. It's not about it being in play format, it's not about introducing new characters, there is a story there about children and their parents that's worth hearing. Some of the best works of art give you enough information to reach your own conclusions, allowing people to find their own meanings as they apply in their own lives. This play takes a backhoe to peaceful grave sites, sleepwalking us through what this or the other much adored character would have thought about everything if they were point-blank asked without leaving any room for speculation or interpretation... sigh... My concern is that if the consensus comes down that this ""new conclusion"" to the series is kinda meh, future generations are going to see the series as a WHOLE, as EIGHT BOOKS, hearing that the ending is sub-par, lessening the chances that they be willing to invest the time to reading that many book at all. ""You have to read Harry Potter, it's one of the best reading experiences I've ever had,"" has become, ""Read Harry Potter, it's amazing, but maybe wait a few years to read Cursed Child and take it with a huge heaping spoonful of salt."" Overnight I've become an HP Purist. That was not how I thought my Monday would go, lemme tell ya. tl;dr: The new play is fanboy fodder and it's going to mess up the brand's place in history if considered ""Book 8.""",TRUE,children

The plot was mediocre and the characters (like Harry) were saying things and acting in ways I know not to be true. There was no feeling, emotion, or excitement that the original Harry Potter books have. It's sad because I had such high hopes for this book and it just was not good.

Unfortunately, this has none of the charm, complexity, depth, or inventiveness of the 7 book series. I seriously question how much J.K. Rowling had to do with it. It really reads like shmaltzy fan fiction. Not only do the new characters have no depth, there's a parade of the old favorite characters that feels like someone had a checklist. ""Did we work Hagrid in? Check! How about Snape? Check!"" It's all very contrived with none of the nuances of the beloved series. Even the three main HP characters suffer from a depletion of complexity. This won't be one that I ever re-read.

If you do not want to read something that is not a book, don't read this. I feel like the story would have been better if J.K. Rowling had written it as a book without two other authors. Definitely not a story that should be passed to someone else to write. This book is definitely an example of why only she can carry the story on perfectly.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Has the flavor of a mediocre fan fiction story: *** WARNING SPOILER ALERT ***,73,"I'm not sure why I bought this - I knew J. K. Rowling didn't actually write it, and sadly it shows. There may have been some mildly good ideas for a future book buried within this storyline which may have worked had Rowling herself written it, but this story didn't turn out that way. All of the characters lacked depth and complexity - the same issue I had with all the Harry Potter movies - and everyone turned out as one dimensional caricatures of themselves. It was silly in some places (such as embellishing the things Ludo Bagman said during the Triwizard Tournament), and just plain ridiculous in others. The liberties taken with all of the characters personalities in regard to the things that made each one inherently unique and individual made the story feel like reading a fan fiction story, and a mediocre one at that. If that's what I wanted I could have probably read a much better story online for free on any number of fan fiction web sites instead of dumping a bunch of money on a story I never want to read again. The characters all had the flavor of eating cold white rice (i.e., bland on bland with nothing on it, and a bit gluey). If this story was a spice it would be air, or tap water flavored. Had there not been names in front of each character's sentences I wouldn't have know whom said what because the dialogue was so similar. Rowling's style of writing makes each character starkly different, she didn't have to spell out whom said what - it was obvious. This story didn't paint a picture leaving your imagination to fill in the blanks - it told you what was happening in the blandest way possible. I could no more ""see"" the offices at the Ministry of Magic, or the kitchen at Harry and Ginny's house in my mind's eye than even believe that they were real places. I really couldn't imagine these characters in any environment other than a dark, spartan stage setting. I have to say regarding Delphi … the thought of Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange getting it on curdles my stomach (and shivers my timbers). Nope, it would NEVER happen - in fact, I think there was a better chance Voldemort and Nagini were an item then Voldemort and Belltrix. Save your money - check this out from the library if you absolutely must read it, but don't expect much. Better yet, go find a really good fan fiction story online instead, as it will likely be much more entertaining. This wasn't the literary magic crafted from Rowling's mind and imagination, and it is obvious.

133821666X,2.0,A depressingly disappointing installment to a beloved series.,3,"This was a horrible disappointment. Let me begin by saying I am not bothered it is a play. I love plays. I knew it was a play when I bought it. This review has nothing to do with the format. The characters in this book, my beloved characters, the characters that I practically grew up with as a child, were not handled with the kind of care and reverence I would have desired. Many of them acted very differently than I would have expected, behaved very differently than I felt their character would. The story, the plot, felt forced and was bland and practically boring. It was somewhat cliche, a bit all over the place, with no real path or purpose. Harry Potter is the pinnacle of coming-of-age stories, and this falls far short of that. Instead it feels like just some way to parade our beloved characters in front of us to earn a fast buck. The ""villain"" has no depth, no purpose beyond just behaving the way they do because of who they are. Evil just for the sake of evil is boring, and makes for a boring story and a unsatisfying conclusion. In the span of a single play, this book attempted to build all of the same relationships and touching moments as the original series so that it felt rushed and poorly planned. It tried to create a strong friendship between the two ""main"" characters, it tried to create tension and fall-out between Harry and his son in order to provide a touching reconciliation. In the final act when things came together and we got the reconciliations between multiple relationships I felt nothing. The story attempted to make the two main boys into heroes like the Harry, Ron and Hermione in the originals, but instead they just come off as rebellious teenagers trying to prove something to themselves and their parents, and almost destroying the world in the processes. The characters we see all grown up, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Draco, and others, none of them really feel like they do their originals justice. Like another reviewer wrote this comes off as a poorly written fan fiction, as whoever wrote this fails to grasp the personalities and characteristics of any of these beloved characters. (HOW is it that Hermione of all people hears that Boomslang Skin and Lacewing Flies are missing and doesn't immediately know what that means and start looking into it?)

So many examples, way too many to list but would Harry really have a distant relationship with one of his children considering his own childhood? So much of it was a cut and paste of events from the original books. Events and outcomes were changed and then went back to where they were. Characters mourned and remembered fondly were back, if only temporarily and it felt like cheating. One particular scene near the end was just cruel and unnecessary.

JK is such a masterful author, she creates the most incredible, vivid alternate word and does this through wonderful prose and lengthy descriptions which the reader gets lost in. This play, in contrast, feels thin, rushed and flimsy. The characters Ron, Hermione and Harry feel like caricatures and, aside from Scorpius, the new characters we meet are underdeveloped and two dimensional. There are grammatical errors throughout - I know it's a play but this is still unacceptable!Without pulling this apart for the sake of it there were also a few parts of this story which didn't sit right or seem feasible (I'm sure they can be explained though). - Why is it so easy for Albus and Scorpius to cast spells on Cedric at the Tri Wizard tournament? Wouldn't all of the opposite teams be doing this to help their representatives all of the way through? - How is Delphi able to spend so long in Godric's Hollow when the time turner only allows 5 minutes? - I just hate the scene where Harry and Dumbledore had their heart to heart and tell each other they love one another.

133821666X,2.0,I wanted to love this,17,"I wanted to love this play/book. I've read the original novels more times than I can count, and love them more and more each time I open them. I wanted to be re-immersed in the world of magic, get to know my old friends as adults, and see what kinds of morals they have instilled in their children, to see if their children could carry on their legacy of fighting for what they believed in. I had extremely high hopes when I opened it up and started reading. I wish I had gone in with no hopes or expectations, because I probably would have been less disappointed if I had. After reading it, it is very clear that JK Rowling did not do any of the writing. It may have been her story, but the voices and portrayals of the characters were so unlike the original books that it's impossible to think she penned any of it. I realize it was made to be a play, not a book, and perhaps seeing it on stage, acted out with special effects and real interactions, would have opened up more of the emotion that was meant to be behind the words, but simply reading them didn't do that. The words just fell flat and the characters lost all of their charm and wits from the original stories. *Mild spoilers* The first 20 pages were great, basically a rehash of the epilogue and then a little bit of time getting to see Albus and Rose navigate the Hogwarts Express just like Harry did his first time on it. It felt very authentic and nostalgic. But from there it went downhill really fast. The plot COULD have been good, if it was used to develop the characters' personalities and not just to bring back characters that we knew and loved (Snape) or hated (Umbridge). Unfortunately, throughout the entire book, I felt like the personalities of every original character just fell flat. They were all brooding and had decided that work was more important than family, which is the opposite of how they acted in the original series, where they did everything they could to protect their families from Voldemort. Albus, for being the main character, was completely under-developed because they skipped through too many years of his early teenage-hood. They never even said why he was sorted into Slytherin when none of the rest of the Potters/Granger-Weasleys were, and that was a pivotal piece of information. It went from ""Albus Severus Potter...SLYTHERIN"" to ""Albus can't get a broom off the ground and hates Quidditch"" to ""Albus is starting his fourth year at Hogwarts,"" all in the span of just a few pages. I think skipping so much of his early time at Hogwarts made him a very emotionless person who it's hard to connect your feelings with. Oddly enough, my favorite character was Scorpius, the offspring of one of the most-hated characters from the original series, because he actually had a chunk of the book devoted to getting to know him and showing his true colors; if every character had had that, I think I would have found a way to relate to them all better. On top of the poor character development all-around, my biggest pet peeve was the idea that Voldemort could possibly have a child. The man whose life mission was never to love or show emotion to those around him would never have involved himself romantically with Bellatrix Lestrange, especially not enough to produce a child. And the idea that that child was born in the Malfoy Manor before the Battle of Hogwarts is ludicrous, because Draco knew nothing about her, and he would certainly have noticed Bellatrix's pregnancy and resulting child while he was living there during his 7th year, yet he was the most surprised of anyone by the revelation that Voldemort had a child. I understand needing a new villain for the story, but it would have been so much more believable if it was anyone but a child of Voldemort's. *End spoilers*",TRUE,children

It was an entirely okay read. Unlike the HP books, I will not re-read it. There were parts that were boring, ridiculous, and it had some contrived ""conflicts."" But it also some good parts, and parts with charming interactions betwen the old characters. Other reviews mention that it feels like internet quality fan fiction, and I agree. Rowling's listed as an author, but I can't even imagine her approving the pages. This book feels like a money grab by the writers/publishers. Oh well, at least I'm just one sucker in millions.

133821666X,2.0,Just Meh,2,"To be fair, you have to keep in mind J.K Rowling did not right this book. Secondly, it is the script for the play.... It's not meant to be a book like we are all used to. The book was ok. If you've seen Butterfly a effect with Ashton Kutcher, you've read this book already. There is some small things that make you go hummm, but I'm going to call it what it is... It's fan fiction. It's meant to raise interest in the Universal Studios attraction and provide the rest of us in the world that can't go see the play a small tidbit to hold on to.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Disappointing,,"No spoilers here, just an overview of my general opinion. I had no problem reading this book in script format (I love theatre), but it left quite a bit out in terms of the details and charm of the original books. My problem with this story is that it doesn't hold true to character traits that we expect from the original characters. I found myself often questioning what I was reading, finding plot holes and very unlikely turns of events. I felt like the authors were really reaching and grabbing at straws, trying to make an exciting story that just doesn't work. I certainly didn't feel that J.K. Rowling had much to do with it. Her writings on Pottermore are significantly more plausible and entertaining. I'm glad that I read it for myself, but wish I hadn't purchased it. Do yourself a favor and borrow it from your library instead of wasting your money.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,this felt like I was revisiting a badly written version of earlier ...,1,"I am a big fan of all of HP novels and have been reading the books since I was 11 years old. Unfortunately, this felt like I was revisiting a badly written version of earlier books. I was expecting a play that gave me more of an insight on Harry's life, his work at the Ministry, his new role as a husband and father, other magical worlds, etc. The first thing that annoyed me in the scene descriptions was the phrase ""this is magic. this is chaos"", which seemed like a condescending gesture toward the reader and which in hindsight actually seem to excuse the unimaginative plot.The time-turner is grossly overused and seems like a cheap plot device. I might have as well watched Back to the Future again . The simultaneous use of two time-turners was even more ludicrous. (So on one time turner they had only 5 minutes to change the past and on another they had more minutes--wouldn't this have had some kind of effect?---otherwise why point out the difference between time-turners... It really seemed like the characters spent hours awkwardly waiting for Voldemort at Godrick's Hollow) The story lacked verisimilitude. Many characters (Rose, Delphi, Ron, Hermione), were left undeveloped. Delphi's intervention at the end seemed forced. She did not play that much of a leading role at the beginning when they were trying to bring Cedric back then she suddenly appears at the end, only after receiving an Owl from Albus. If she really was planning to bring back Voldemort she would have intervened earlier. Finally, the idea that Voldemort and Bella had sex in some room of Malfoy's Manor was laughable and implausible, given Rowling's characterization of Voldemort.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Doesn't measure up,1,"I love J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter series. I read them all as an adult so therefore don't romanticize them simply because I ""grew up"" reading them. I knew what I was getting into with this book. Screenplay format, Rowling only as ""co-author"", sequel set many years after Book 7, etc. Given that, I frankly expected it to be not as good as the original series books. But this really wasn't good. The richness of the original Potter books was missing. The characters lacked any development or depth. Even characters original to the series seemed like hijacked versions of themselves. It was like instead of becoming wiser and more introspective with age as one would hope (expect?) they actually became more ignorant and pathetic. The plot wasn't completely terrible, although it was extremely thin as far as Harry Potter books go. I know some people might argue that it's not fair to hold this book to the same standard as the originals, but if we're expected to believe this is the next extension of the Harry Potter world, then that bar is already very high and this just doesn't measure up.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Everyone's saying it because it's true - bad fanfic,,"SPOILER ALERTS AHEAD!!! Scorpius was the only decent character in my opinion. He was well-written and felt like more of a hero in the book than Albus did. Everyone else was either wildly out of character (Snape cracking jokes?! Voldemort has a daughter?! Get out of here with that) or just flat-out annoying. I've heard it's more entertaining to watch on the stage, but that's very likely only because in theater the focus tends to be more on the theatrics first. Yes, it's written in play format, but it's not really distracting and provides an easy read. Hackneyed events, characters wildly incongruent with their book and movie versions, and ridiculous plot devices really, really do make this feel like a horrible fanfiction, or at least an encyclopedia of all the worst tropes one tends to find in them.

It is easy to tell that it was written ""based on her work"" and not by her work. I feel a bit cheated by the quality, it didn't live up the hype.

133821666X,2.0,NOT Harry Potter,1,"First of all, I was not looking forward to reading this as it was meant to be a play and I wanted to see it on stage, but as I live in Argentina and could not get tickets when I travelled to London, I ended up buying the kindle edition. As a huge HP fan I was willing to give this book a chance, even knowing that it was not written by JK Rowling. I think it was very deceitful how it was promoted (in Argentina people were talking about the 8th Harry Potter book!), but I was willing to overlook this for the love of Potter. I had very low expectations...but the script doesn't even live up to them. The characters have lost their essence, the dialogues are very choppy, the situations are unbelievable and the plot is full of holes. *SPOLIERS* What I didn’t like: 1. I do not believe that Voldemort would have a child. He is not a sexual being, he is driven by power. Also, maybe this is different in wizard world, but Bellatrix should be too old to be able to carry a baby. 2. If they had had a baby in Malfoy manor, Draco would know about this. They were living in the same house! How come this never comes up? He never tells anyone? 3. I understand that Draco kind of redeems himself at the end of Deathly Hallows, but he is still a Death Eater...how come he raises the best kid in the whole story? Albus is a whiny self-centered drama queen and Rose is a selfish snob. In the epilogue of the books they show that they are not really aware of their parents’ fame, so why would Rose show this entitlement about having to choose carefully their friends because everyone would want to be their friend? I cannot believe that a child raised by Hermione and Ron would be this cold and stuck up!!! 4. Leave Dumbledore alone. He does not deserve to appear in such a stupid, blubbering manner. 5. My biggest problem: the PLOT. If we are supposed to believe that this was all Delphi's plan, how come Albus thinks about it? Did she incept this idea in his mind? if so, this should have been made more clear. In order to ""surprise"" us with the fact that she is the villain they left a huge plot hole, because Albus decides by himself (after overhearing a conversation) that he is going to help Mr. Diggory, he escapes the Hogwarts express with much difficulty, finds the retirement home (how?), informs them of his plan, finds pollyjuice potion (how?), has parts of Ron, Harry and Hermione to change into and decides to steal the timeturner and go back to save Cedric. How did Delphini plan this? It is really very improbable. 6. In the alternate reality where Ron and Hermione never marry we are presented with a bitter, unfulfilled, cold Hermione...yeah...right. Because she cannot find professional and personal success without a husband and kids by her side. This is so sexist and un-Rowling like that it made me sick. 7. Harry forbids Albus from being friends with Scorpius. This is stupid, out of character and annoying. AND he is nasty to Prof. MacGonagall (who must be really old by now!) 8. I will not believe that Cedric could EVER become a Death Eater. This is stupid. We are presented with a character who is good, and noble. No amount of humiliation would have turned him into a DE 9. So, Hermione is the Minister of Magic but she doesn’t increase or improve the security. To the point that the kids infiltrate it the same way that she already did! She knows that this is a flaw in security! And, as someone else stated in their review, how come the Ministry does nothing to dispel the rumor that Scorpius is Voldy’s son???? Hermione cannot be such a bad Minister! She is supposed to be the cleverest witch of her time! 10. The people who wrote this script are not really familiar with how magic works in this Universe. They forgot how to make pollyjuice potion (Albus thinks that it would be a good plan and they discard this idea because they do not have a part of Voldemort, nobody points out that they need at least a month to brew it!!! And it is not possible to transfigure a person into someone else! This was never presented during the 7 books! It is unacceptable that it is possible now. What about the FIDELIUS CHARM?????? How can they all see Harry’s parents, find his house??????????? They were in hiding!!!!!! This is just sloppy! Or maybe there is an explanation and I can’t find it. 11. I won’t get into the whole time travel plot hole, but it is lazy and stupid. I would have preferred a new story and adventure and leave the past in the past. What I liked: 1. Taking a glimpse at my beloved characters again(although they are not themselves) 2. Scorpius. He is by far the best character in the story. 3. Going back to Godric’s Hollow. 4. Finding out that Harry has some contact with Duddley. 5. Scorpius and Albus friendship…maybe even more? I loved them together. I really hope that the stage version is better: probably with good acting and special effects this could be entertaining. I insist on telling all my friends that this is NOT the 8th Harry Potter book! It is not. I hope that JK Rowling writed something more about this story in Pottermore to clarify this errors and make me love the future Harry Ron and Hermione as much as their book versions!",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Review from a theatre grad,18,"Yikes, this is quite bad. I have a theatre degree and therefore I'm no stranger to scripts, so the format isn't a big problem for me. The problem, however, is the writing, storyline, and characters; which are pretty big problems to have!! It's written like someone who has read a few plays but never written one would, ie, poorly. The plot is not very good, even when it finally takes off in the 2nd half. The characters are ghosts of themselves, in ways that are insulting to fans of the series.

So even though I knew it was just a play script that J.K didn't write but liked it enough to let them put her name on it, I had to read it for myself. There is no way this should be officially thought of as the 8th story. She ended 7 fine and this just completely ruins that epilogue, she should never have let this be considered part of the HP universe. I went into this with low expectations and I was still a little disappointed. The characters don't act like they would if this were written by J.K. or any normal fan that know and love them as much as a lot of us do. The story skips over a bunch of things-i get it, it's a play... But the first few years at Hogwarts in the beginning were just a waste. You get to see some of the characters you love but others that you assume will be in it are completely ignored. I mean, the story has Hogwarts in it, where is Neville? Where is Hagrid? You're left completely in the dark about what has happened to a lot of these characters, not even a mention of them if they are alive or dead. The story itself is a bit ridiculous and is completely predictable. I won't give any spoilers but the whole thing is just one person after another whining about their daddy issues. Read this if you are curious and make your own decisions, but for me I wish I hadn't.

This book had potential but unfortunately it did not live up to it. I feel as if whoever wrote this didn't stay true to the characters, I could not picture Malfoy's character saying or doing half the stuff they have him doing in this book.

Do you think there is any possible way an 8th story would have met expectations, even if it was in a book format? You should listen to the warnings the original series gave us about bringing back the dead. Harry Potter is basically your childhood. The stakes were astronomically high. Wait, did Back to the Future and Twilight have a baby? I’m not sure. I got lost. Too many time turners, and I’m not buying that “Voldy” (how sensitive, after a generation of genocide) had a kid. How could J.K. Rowling write this? She didn’t. If you read it as fan fiction, you will be less disappointed. “It is a script, dummies. You aren’t experiencing the real story because you have to see it in person.” What percentage of the fan base can feasibly fly to London and secure a ticket? Why on earth are they selling the script for twenty-bucks a pop if it can’t stand alone? And I’m sorry, but a plot hole is a plot hole. Why revisit and muck up the great, iconic scenes (as much fun as it will be to re-read the Triwizard Tournament picturing two dorky boys lurking around)? Why not create an original story? Wait, did Ron just turn into Fred or George Weasley? Love potion gag gifts? Didn’t he almost die from one of those once upon a time? Come to think of it, are any of the characters themselves? I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Hermione so incompetent or Harry so blah. And I’m totally buying that a little humiliation from the ever-courageous Cedric turned him into a raging death eater. Serious question, why is Draco not in Azkaban? He was a known death eater. Why is Bellatrix rotting away while he is out and about with his secret time turner? Come on, wasn’t there anything positive? The nervous, I-might-throw-up emotional excitement I felt for a sustained five minutes before I could muster the courage to open the book was thrilling (it is not every day you think you get to read Harry Potter again for the first time). To be fair, I also had a hard time putting this script down. Humanizing Slytherin was a good move. Scorpius is a decent character. Meeting Snape again was nice. If this was published and recognized as fan fiction, I might give it a 3/5. I’m holding back my final judgments until I can see the work as intended, a full performance. Does this merit “Obliviate?” Unclear. My initial gut feeling says stick with the original canon. I’ll accept this as fan fiction and save my pennies for Hamilton.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,A Shadow By Comparison,41,"I'm not going to write a long, detailed review here because quite simply - it isn't worth the time. This is a very weak follow-up to the Original Harry Potter series and in my opinion should be read under the caveat - Fan Fiction!!!! I was looking forward to this, but I am truly crestfallen. It's really a shame because this is feeling a little bit like what happened with Star Wars. When people (like myself) become so caught up in something like Harry Potter, or Star Wars, they hunger for some type of continuation in that wonderful time a place. The moments spent there hold a magical place in all our hearts. But sometimes, it seems even more difficult for the creator of a series to just let things end, even more than for the fans who love their work. The new information we are given just isn't up to par and often it weakens the older work. In the case of the world of Harry Potter, the new facts that have been disclosed post Deathly Hallows, for the most part have been unnecessary, or for me, even unwanted. Ms. Rowling has every right to put out new and unknown details if she wishes. But I, as a fan, have every right to dislike it and say it isn't worthy. And so it is with this work. I still hold out high hopes for the Magical Beasts and Where To Find Them movie in November - But this, well I think I would have been happier never reading this. DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE A CONTINUATION OF THE ORIGINAL J.K ROWLING STORIES. I FEEL YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!",TRUE,children

Rowling put her name on this. Don't expect to have any great insights into the Harry Potter world you fell in love with or you will be disappointed.

The story is very disjointed, plot lines and characters are underdeveloped, and the finale is a giant train wreck leaving the reader asking, ""that's it?"" PRO - This is written as a play. At first this annoyed me, but it is somewhat refreshing to see a play that will receive such widespread release. Hopefully this can help renew interest among readers for plays. CON - The writing is just not good. I question how much involvement Rowling actually had with this story. I definitely question her actually putting pen to paper on it. - The story is so disjointed. It skims by characters without any kind of introduction or background. This should have been expanded into two or three books to have made any sense. - The ending is awful. Throughout the play you know it is building towards some big apex which then fails to materialize. As a result, you are left with no sense of closure.

It's not that it is awful in and of itself (I was likely looking for problems, as the original series was quite well thought out), but when an author/playwright undertakes a continuation of a series, s/he has an even tougher ob ahead of her/him than just writing--they have to stick to what has already been written.

133821666X,2.0,Harry Potter and the Perils of Ascended Fanfiction,3,"The Harry Potter series of books (the seven ones in the main series and the three ""Hogwarts Library"" complimentary ones) are popular for a good reason. They're not your ""flavor of the week"" fad and they're trend setters rather than followers. They're timeless, engaging, well written mystery novels that are far more interesting and smarter than the movie adaptations make them look (not that the movies are BAD, quite the opposite, but people who are only familiar with the series through them are certainly missing a lot). Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, referred to as ""the eight story"" is none of that. It's certainly not a book, since it's a play, so what we have here is a rehearsing script. Now that's fine. It's understandable, expected and I have no problem with it. The problem is everything else. Unlike the books, this story is derivative, predictable, self-indulgent and dumb. It has many of the characters seen in the original books, but they're there in name only, since their personalities are certainly not the same. Also long gone? The smart writing, the nail-biting mystery, the sense of adventure and anything close to actual life-lessons, replaced with childish attempts that border on humorless parody. This story is fanfiction, and it falls into its most notable pits, doing no effort to avoid them. Let me give you an example. Picture you and your significant other are shopping and you say: ""Hey, we should buy milk"", so she/he replies ""We can't do that, we have no milk!"". Spot the lapse in logic there? How you offer a solution to a problem and the other person replies by simply stating the problem which you're giving a solution to? Note how preposterous that is, and how dumb it would be if you just accepted it? Let me show you the example on the book: Two guys and a girl are about to use a Time-Turner to travel back in time. One of the guys proposes an idea: GUY: ""... we're going back without any knowledge of whether we can travel back afterwards... maybe we should just - try going back an hour first, say, first and then..."" GIRL: ""I'm sorry, GUY, we have no time to waste."" No time? NO TIME? You have a freaking Time-Turner RIGHT. THERE. Time is what you have THE MOST of. More than anyone else. Heck, the entire idea he was giving you was to MAKE TIME. Your response makes no sense! And the fact that neither of the guys point it out is even worse. Now this might sound like nitpicking, but this particular bit of dialogue showcases the main problem with this strictly plot-driven story: logic is set aside because the plot demands things happen. Characters will go against their personalities because the plot demands things happen. This is just one of the many aforementioned pits of fanfiction. Here's a short list of others: - The Mary Sue: this is a character that has no flaws, can't fail and always has the right thing to say to solve a situation. - The Obvious Villain: this is the character that you will easily peg as the villain the moment they show up even though the story treats it like an unexpected twist when it's revealed. A telling sign is that they're too eager to make the plot advance. - The Derivative Callback: what's a writer to do when he wants to evoke the same feelings from a work someone else started without having any idea how to write well? Simple, he just writes scenes that are similar to ones created by the original writer in hopes that the memories of the previous ones will be enough to give readers the same feeling. In this particular case, this gets too on the nose when two guys and a girl use Polyjuice Potion to sneak into the Ministry of Magic to steal a trinket. I wish I was kidding. - The Manufactured Drama: this one's obvious. Drama has to happen, so while two characters could talk like normal people instead they choose to either stay silent or break character just for it to occur, because the writer has no idea how to bring it naturally. - The Forced Pathos: a writer wants the reader to feel sad, but he can't write compelling drama, so what does he do? Simple, he repeats sad scenes that the previous writer created. The difference with The Derivative Callback is that these aren't just similar, they're literally the same scenes, step by step, shown either by flashback or time travel. - The Superpowerful villain: a writer wants the stakes to feel higher, so what's he to do when he can't write compelling characters or situations? Well, he gives the villain incredible powers, of course, whether these make sense in the story or not. ""Oh, you thought the previous villain was powerful? No, here's version 3.0, that old geezer has nothing on MY guy! What's that? That there's no precedent for this kind of power in this universe? Blah, I don't understand those words, look at the fireworks!"" - The Ship: Sigh. I, of course, mean ""ship"" not as a vessel, but as a verb, as in ""I'm going to pair these two characters together wheter it makes literally no sense or... wait, ESPECIALLY if it makes literally no sense"". This is probably the most known one in fanfiction (so much that it has its own subcategory, called slash fiction), but it's especially painful here. Once you read who's certain person's father you'll know instantly who the writer decided would be the mother, even though, again, it makes literally no sense. Please understand that I gave this story a fair chance. I was actually very excited for it, I preordered this book back in February. I knew it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling, but I also knew she's not the only good writer in the world, so I gave this what I thought was a well-deserved opportunity. Instead, I was ""rewarded"" with having to read what appears to be some blogger's Harry Potter, Back to the Future and It's a Wonderful Life's fanfictions all rolled-up into one. Make no mistake, this is amateur writing at its worst. I have nothing against fanfiction. I've read some very, very good Harry Potter fanfiction in the past, but for the life of me I can't believe writing this poor ever got such a chance. I absolutely don't recommend it, but if you HAVE to read it, then go prepared. Adjust your expectations as low as possible and you might draw some enjoyment out of it. But it will still never feel like the touted ""eight story"".",TRUE,children

I understand this is not a HP novel, and went into this with no expectations other than to read more into a world that I am already very fascinated in. To my amazement, I couldn't finish the book. It's not the screenplay writing style, or the dialogue-centered narrative, it's the stupid plot and the feeling I am reading a Middle schoolers HP fan fiction that makes it hard for me to look at this book on my shelf. It doesn't belong next to the Harry Potter Novels I proudly display high on the second shelf, eye level for optimal contact with the other impeccable J.K. Rowling novels.

I first started reading Harry Potter when I was in middle school and I am 30 years old now. I picked this up hoping it would be comparable or 'exceed expectations,' if you would. I expected it to be different given this is in a script form, but what I didn't expect was the characters to be so unlike the characters we fell in love with in the original books...I will not add any spoilers except to say I wish there was a bit more originality in the plot!!

Having read and re-read all the books with my kids (as bedtime stories) I wondered how tired my voice would be with while I read as every character and honestly it wasn't very a tired at all seeing as how I simply couldn't read this the same way I read ANY of the previous books with them. This book is simply not in any way what we all hoped. It was exciting waiting for it and sadly We as a group were disappointed. I'd say buy it as a long time fan, buy it to know what happens but don't buy it if you are expecting any of the feeling you had reading any of the other books for the first time. Know it isn't (or doesn't feel or read like) a true Harry Potter story. It is simply missing the the essence that Rowling alone had infused in her previous books.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,"Couldn't finish. Really tried, but couldn't do it",2,"I am definitely the only person out of my group of friends who hated this book. Assuming you read the synopsis, I'll just explain my disgust: 1. I immensly dislike he main character. I've read books where villains and mean/terrible people lead the story, so I enjoy reading about a character with a few flaws or personal struggles. This one was overly pathetic. It figures this would be about a kid who doesn't compare to his dad, the great Harry Potter. Who would? It's Harry freakin Potter! There are 7 epic books about what an amazingly strong and courageous character he is! Even he started off with a few struggles before growing into the champion he was. I don't understand how this is the best plot idea that was established. Why are so many people comparing this kid to his dad? And why isn't this kid ridiculously proud of his dad? He has a sour attitude about wanting to establish a separate identity, but his actions don't reflect his wishes. Instead he just keeps brooding. 2. This could still be part of #1, but it felt to important to mesh in there. I don't like how he made me react as a reader, and I'm so mad that this kid made me think that he needed a time out. I am nobody's mother, so how dare he entice the urge to yell at him for acting so childish and disrespectful to his dad! He has a great life, with a family that loves him, so he should be more appreciative of the things he's taking for granted. This is the first time I have ever sided with a parent in a book. A parent. Now I feel old and wizened over teenaged drama. This kid is a huge jerk. 3. I completely understand that this book was not written by J.K. Rowling. I want to state that I was not expecting a similar writing style, tone of voice or even similar level of creativity. That being said, Harry, Ron and Hermione sounded absolutely nothing like Harry, Ron and Hermione, respectively. I was expecting a little change since they're older, but really, these are characters who have been through a war of chaos, stress and anguish, only to grow old sounding like a group of guest stars on Sesame Street. I enjoyed the play format of the book, but with so much riding on dialogue, I was struggling to accept these as the same characters that J.K. Rowling created. I think 2 stars is overly generous, but that's because I've probably placed my expectations a little too high to begin with.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Okay!,,All in all it is a good read if you want to know what happens 19 years later but that's just about it. Don't expect this book to take you into the world of magic and that of Hogwarts. What I liked: 1. The story after 19 years. 2. It is in the form of a play. 3. That Albus and Scorpius are best buds. What I did not like: 1. They have seriously messed up the concept of the time-turner. 2. The story is predictable. 3. It seemed more like watching (reading) one of the Harry Potter movies (I didn't like it as much as the original books).,TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Mischief Managed. Magic? Not so much.,4,"I grew up anxiously awaiting the release of each new Harry Potter book and was so excited to read this play. Instead of waiting in line for hours to get my copy, I ordered online to be electronically delivered at midnight to my Kindle. I delved into the play looking forward to stepping back into my favorite book worlds ... instead I was disappointed. I was expecting the play format, and that did not bother me, though, like all other fans, I would have loved a novel. Given the constraints inherent to plays, I think this would be a good, fun play to see in person. I also really liked the Scorpius character. However, unfortunately, I found many things lacking. First and foremost, there were some continuity issues. For example, all polyjuice potions tasted like fish in this play, when we were previously told the taste depended on the person one was transforming into in the novels. I also was disappointed that some much be love characters, such as Hagrid and Luna were not mentioned in this book in the present, while other less important characters were. (Hagrid was mentioned in the past.) Additionally, I found the storyline to be trite and rather predictable, along with some things being implausible or unlikely given what we know about the wizarding world or our beloved characters. (I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I will leave out the details.) There were many things that could still be fleshed out or more developed, such as what happened to Astoria Greengas Malfoy. All in all, it wasn't a complete train wreck, but much to my disappointment, it lacked the magic of the original 7 novels. It was worth reading, but $14.99 was a little much for the length, depth, and format of this story. If the play comes to the States, though, I would love to see it.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Interested in the final version...,2,"Well, this is a mite disappointing. As someone that grew up with the books and films, I was quite looking forward to this. While the character of Scorpius is fun and there are some good moments, I find it severely lacking. As others have pointed out, some of the characters don't seem like themselves (this is most noticeable with Ron). Then there's the whole Voldemort takeover alternate timeline - it seemed like something straight out of Tara Gilesbie's infamous fanfiction ""My Immortal"", it doesn't seem like something Rowling would write. I half expected Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and her buddies to show up. The Blood Ball? Voldemort Day? You're joking, right? The play itself seems to be getting rave reviews and apparently this isn't the final version. I'm interested in the final version to see what's been changed (and hopefully improved). For now, this is a disappointment.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Mediocre fanfiction with no J.K. Rowling to be found,5,"I came into reading this script after seeing some of the other reviews, so I took their advice to read it as more fanfiction than cannon. Even for fanfiction, it was mediocre. Nearly every element of the story (the spells, the plot devices) was recycled from previous books and many characters were unrecognizable. They were also often nearly indistinguishable - I feel a truly good script is one where I know which character says which line without needing to read the labels. In this script, I wouldn't know if a line was delivered by the teenage boys or by Hermoine Granger. Perhaps the worst representation was of Ron, who frankly, had none of the life of the previous character. He vaguely reminded me of Fred, but frankly, was flat even for Fred. Harry himself seems to have been transported back to the 5th Harry Potter book, seemingly unaware of the progress he has made in understanding Dumbledore. There appears to be no sign of chemistry between him and his wife Ginny, although she is the best-developed character in the script. His behavior, especially after the 2nd incident (hopefully that's vague enough not to spoil and clear enough to tell you when), is completely nonsensical. For a second, I was wondering whether he'd become possessed by a certain former minister of magic! The last thing to be mentioned is how feminine all the characters seem. Everyone seems very open about speaking about their emotions (although, unfortunately, not in showing these emotions without speaking), very fragile, and very defined by their attachments to others. Ron, for example, can be completely summarized as ""bumbling fool who loves Hermione"" and Albus can be summarized as ""angsty teenager who is obsessed with his best friend."" SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: the repetition of what friends the two boys are and how much they need each other and the constant brooding gave me, like some of the other reviewers, the impression that the script was leading up to a romantic relationship between the two protagonists. Either these elements should have been eliminated in favor for more typical demonstrations of friendship, or the ending should have fulfilled this expectation. Ironically, the original Harry Potter books have plenty of great depictions of male friendship that doesn't leave the reader confused about whether the two characters are romantically interested in each other or not. END SPOILER. Overall, this script is basically rather-flawed fanfiction that bears only a distant resemblance to the Harry Potter series. It is nice nostalgia, and I don't regret the couple of hours I spent reading it, but frankly... I did feel cheated given the price I paid and the quality of what I got.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,I'm So Disappointed,10,"I wanted to like this play. I've been waiting forever it seems. I'm a pretty dedicated Harry Potter super fan, so when this was announced, I was pretty dang excited! I pestered my poor boyfriend for months to buy it for my birthday, and now it's just a huge letdown. First off, I WANTED to like it. J.K. Rowling is a queen, but she didn't write this. I highly doubt she was even involved with this. She couldn't have been. The writing was terrible. TERRIBLE. Words and actions were so out of character for our beloved childhood heroes. (I understand this is a play, but I don't think the characters would talk the way they did or act the way they did in the play). Also, Ron was too much comic relief for me. He's typically the comic relief in the series, but he was completely over the top (at least from what I could tell). I'd like to see the play to make my final decision for him. The plot was awful. It was like the actual author (Jack Thorne) discovered all of the weirdest fanfictions ever conceived and spun it into this terrible web of a plot. It was completely unbelievable and I am so ticked off. Plus (SPOILER ALERT) I can believe Voldemort had a child, but did she have to be such a ""perfect"" character (Mary Sue, in other terms)? She had no flaws (other than being a villian) and really no substance to her character. Actually, none of the characters had any real substance and all seemed a little flat to me. I understand, however, that this is a play and that emotions and actions being conveyed are probably better seen on stage. But Harry especially seemed out of character and that bothered me quite a bit. He's always been a bit of an idiot at times, but I have a difficult time believing he would tell his own child, ""I wish you weren't my son."" That is very un-Harry like. I know that's integral to the plot, but still. Again, I'm disappointed. I wish this play had never been written and I'm still in disbelief J.K. Rowling allowed this plot to happen. This is the first time that Harry Potter has ever let me down and I love the Harry Potter series so much. I'm hoping that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is not the gigantic let-down this play was.",TRUE,children

But I feel as though Rowling lost the voices for her characters. Like she lost touch with them for 19 years, and tried desperately to see the rich, developed, intricate friends she used to know. The heroic trio (Harry, Hermione, and particularly Ron) are mere shadows of their younger selves. The main duo (Albus and Scorpius) are flat, and their motivations clumsily explained. Maybe this installment is better left to live performances, where in life magic can distract, and misdirect, the audience from the lack of a coherent storyline.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,So Disappointed!!!,,"While this script was an attempt to continue the Harry Potter story to some degree, it was nowhere in the same realm as JK Rowling's masterful novels.

I read every book eight times or more each book. I've watched every movie more than three times. I'm still obsessed with Harry Potter. However, this story felt nothing close to what we've been accostumed to. Every part, every plot point, felt forced, struggling with the common sense of reality. Most things happen by the hand of randomness, almost every conflict solves itself by casual chances too. I'm very pissed off Jo let something like this be published. I didn't feel her hand in here. I didn't feel most of the old characters were true to their motives and objectives. Some of them react—too—by randomness. Nevertheless, the conflict between Harry and his kid was touching and moved me. That's the only reason I don't totally hate this book. Besides, I loved the personality of Rose and I totally loved Scorpius. Albus was good too. About the old ones, I couldn't help but totally emphitise with Harry, Draco, Ginny and Hermione—although the last one had thoughts and actions way dumber than young clever Hermione. Ron was so stupid... And Minerva McGonagall, oh my God, they totally destroyed the character and made her very soft.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Big Disappointment,5,"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child by John Tiffany & Jack Thorne, based on the original story by J. K. Rowling is actually a script for theatre. This is the story of an adult Harry Potter and primarily his son, Albus and his best friend, Scorpius (Draco's son). It deals with parenting, expectations and time travel. In my mind, this one was nowhere near as good as any of the others in the Harry Potter series. It was mostly nostalgic in that it revisits the Triwizard Tournament from Goblet of Fire and some old characters make an appearance. I did not like: The plot with Delphi was completely out of the blue and really didn't seem possible, so the book seemed corny. I really missed J. K. Rowling's writing! The grown versions of Harry, Hermione and Ron were dull and seemed like totally different people. (Harry ordering Prof. McGonagall around seemed very out of character and that's just one example of many.) Harry had three children, but James and Lily are barely even mentioned. Same with Ron and Hermione's son, barely mentioned. It lacks the humor the other Harry Potter books had and just didn’t make enough sense to be good. (This one only had a couple funny parts--Hermione's daughter Rose was a bright spot and Ron was still kind of funny but it seemed forced.) I liked: Draco and his son, Scorpius. That it is a quick read and wasn't bored with it or felt I was plowing through. Harry and his son Albus coming to understand each other--heartwarming. Ron and Hermione's daughter, Rose, because she takes after Hermione. If I had to sum it up in one word, it would be blah. I would not recommend buying this book and wish I had used the money I spent on it for something else. Get it from the library and save your money. If you read it not expecting it to be good like the others, then you probably will enjoy it, somewhat.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,A plot straight out of bad fanfiction,12,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS* There are some things to like here, and I guess it's ok for a Harry Potter fix. But the entire play has got a huge fanfiction vibe that brings it all down. The biggest problems: - Revisiting scenes from the novels was a bad decision. For that matter, so was having the story revolve around Voldemort again. There have been other dark wizards, like Grindelwald. A new bad guy with no real connection to Voldemort would have been far more interesting. It might have been interesting if the new bad guy didn't even admire Voldemort. - Like a lot of fanfiction, it broke the rules established for the universe to serve the authors' wishes. Time Turners can now change the past, when Prisoner of Azkaban went to great pains to show how that wasn't how time travel worked. Harry suddenly regains the abilities he had when a piece of Voldemort was living inside him, when the elimination of that piece of Voldemort was well-established as the only way that Voldemort could actually be killed, and it is unambiguous in Deathly Hallows that Voldemort is quite dead. Ron was never established as a practical joker, so why would his eventual employment be the joke shop? - Voldemort has a kid. Cliché. Dumb. And I can't even see Voldemort wanting to be intimate with someone, not even Bellatrix. - Voldemort's kid is evil, so apparently being evil was not a choice Tom Riddle made but was just part of his genetic makeup. It probably would have been more interesting if Scorpius had actually turned out to be Voldemort's son and also a good person. - The relationship between Albus and Scorpius is weirdly-written and is distracting. It seems to tease at the idea that they might be gay, but they don't seem to be. There's no reason why they needed to be, and in some ways I think it would have been a worse decision if they were. But pick one. Either go all in or leave it out. Since they are not gay in the end, their dialogue comes across as stilted (for example, ""As pleasurable as it will be to hide in a hole with you for the next forty years...they will find us.""; teenagers don't talk like that in general, and even less so if they aren't expressing an attraction). - The whole ""will Ron and Hermione wind up together or not?"" thing was worn out even in the original novels. It really didn't need to be brought back in the time travel segments. - Surely there were better ideas than ""Cedric turned into a Death Eater because he got really embarrassed that one time, causing the apocalypse"". I could go on, but I think it's pretty clear that there are some severe problems here. I don't exactly regret reading it, but it was nowhere near what it could have been and should have been. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that I would have loved a fresh story in the Harry Potter universe. But this one was one part rehash and two parts stuff that the poorest fanfiction writers come up with. So I didn't love it, and I can't even say I particularly liked it. What little good there is here doesn't begin to compensate for the bad, so the best I can say is ""meh"".",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,And that becomes terribly clear very early on,494,"Ian Malcolm: I’ll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you’re using here: it didn’t require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn’t earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don’t take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you’re selling it, you want to sell it. Let's be clear...this was not written by JK...this is based on her series. And that becomes terribly clear very early on. Additionally, the number of names that are dropped is astronomical! Anyone worth knowing in the Potterverse is up front and counted. As in main character. The story, the plotline...it meanders all over the place that the reader wonders if the writers had a clue to start with or if it was just to ""stand on the shoulders of geniuses."" There was no way this was going to fail...none. The generation that grew up reading Harry's stories are now buying their own books and financing their own plays. Their imagination was set free with JK's works and personally I think that was one of her greatest gifts...engaging our imagination. This reads like fan fiction, poorly written fan fiction and not even with any good ships! Your writers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should. Don't do it. Keep Harry, Ron, Hermione, McGonagall, Ginny alive in your memories instead.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Be advised: J.K. Rowling did not write this play,1,"I (like most of the people who read this play) grew up loving the Harry Potter series. I must have reread all seven books a dozen times at least... which is why I could tell right away that J.K. Rowling did not write this. Since her name came first on the credits, I assumed that she had creative control over this project, but I did some research once I had finished and found that this was not the case. She gave the other authors pointers here and there, and perhaps gave them some insight into the characters that only she, their creator, could have, but other than that she had little to nothing to do with this play. I wish I had known that before I bought the book, so I will say it clearly to you right now: if you are looking for a follow-up to the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling herself, this book is not for you. The story isn't bad and it has some really clever twists, but it reads like a bland fanfiction story (which, in a way, I guess it is). The characters don't have the same ""voice"" as they did in the original series, and it is jarring to read. It is someone else's interpretation of what our beloved characters should sound like, and this made it feel fake to me. The characters also don't speak in a way that sounds natural in general, even aside from them not sounding like themselves. Another thing I didn't like was that everything in the text was clearly designed to manipulate readers based on their sense of nostalgia. Events from prior books were brought up just for the sake of saying ""hey, remember that thing that happened in that other book you loved? I remember too."" This took time out of the real story and led to too quick of a wrap-up at the end of what could have been a hugely monumental reveal/crisis in the wizarding world, as well as to a complete dismissal of several new characters who were introduced in the beginning of the play. Basically, this play takes bits and pieces from all of the real Harry Poter books and uses them to try to tell a new story that falls flat. Of course we all want to know what happened to our favorite characters after the Harry Potter series ended, but that is the beauty of reading a really good book: the author brings you to the end of her story, and then you get to decide in your mind how everything turned out beyond that. It is understandable, though, that people jump at the chance to read a follow-up supposedly written by the woman who started it all - but I think now that it might have just been better to let the original seven books end where they ended, and leave the rest to your own imagination. The thing that bothered me most about this play is not that it is a bad story in and of itself, it is that it was falsely advertised. Sometimes it is fun to read Harry Potter fanfictions online, but you always know that those are not written by J.K. Rowling herself. This book has her name on it, but she was hardly involved with its creation at all. This felt like a betrayal of her readers, and I feel cheated on both a financial level (even as an ebook this book was not cheap!) and on a personal level. I feel like a great friend from my childhood just lied to me to make more money for herself.",TRUE,children

133821666X,2.0,A quick read that is sure to disappoint most,1,"The real question I have after reading this is why was it released at all? As a live play I am sure it is wonderful, with the full sets and great acting, it seems like audiences love it. But as a script? Released with so much publicity? It really falls short. Obviously I was not expecting a JK Rowling book with character development and a strong plot, but I was expecting it to be faithful to the original characters and cannon. Also the writing, I know it is a play but this is so basic. It reads, as others have stated, as a mediocre piece of fan fiction. The best thing about this is probably the character of Scorpius Malfoy. The low point - realizing that Ron is nothing more than a bumbling fool who was drunk when he married Hermione and now runs the joke shop. It doesn't mesh up with the Ron we know. And this play doesn't mesh with the Harry Potter books we all love. It is a disappointing addition to the Harry Potter world.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,What a disappointment ... tempered by one single line in the whole book,,"What a disappointment. My kids grew up with Harry Potter books: They sharpened their literary teeth on discussions of whether Snape was a villain or a hero and dug through the book for details to prove one another wrong before they ever heard the words ""textual evidence"" in school. They looked forward to midnight premieres (books and movies) with the same excitement they'd reserve for a big vacation. I fully expect to have grandchildren named after characters from the series. I say this to show that we're not casual fans who've watched the movies a couple times. I'll say it again: What a disappointment this book turned out to be. Yeah, it's a play, but the scenes are all short and void of anything resembling the enthralling world that exists in the first seven books. The magical details that flesh out the characters' lives in the book series make only token appearances in this story line, and no new magic comes to life; instead, we see scenes from the original book series from different points of view. It almost feels like an outline for another story -- as if the writer (I really doubt JKR did much of the writing) penciled in the bare bones of the plot line and intended to return to fill in the good stuff later --- but never returned. It's not entertaining as a book, and I would not buy a ticket to see it on stage. The characters do not behave in a manner consistent with their first-seven-book counterparts. A character becomes a death eater? A character essentially volunteers to die? All of the adults are too busy to pay attention to their kids, yet they don't seem to have much of a social life, and although they have big career titles, we don't really see that aspect of their lives either. So what are they doing? This didn't ""feel"" like the world we know and love. The worst sin, of course, was at the end when the group all went to witness a certain life changing event; sometimes you just have to bluntly speak the truth: That was stupid. The younger generation was no better. The children's personalities aren't well developed, which is a let-down, given that in the original series the characters are what MAKES the book -- even the secondary characters seem to jump off the page with personalities full of both good and bad. I also didn't like the heavy-handed homosexual overtones between the two main characters; it seemed stilted, as if the writers considered bringing in a theme of tolerance/acceptance ... but couldn't quite get around to deciding whether it was a theme or not, so it just comes off as a weird, incomplete tangent. I started to give this book one star, which would be fair for the majority of the book ... but I gave it a two because of ONE SINGLE LINE Harry speaks in the final scene. For those who've read the book, it's the line when he says, ""Yes, but you forget that I never _______."" That one line was pure Harry Potter. That line encompassed the friendship and dedication that umbrellas the whole series, and it speaks to Harry's bravery and his determination to do what's right at any cost. That one line was better than the entire book combined.",TRUE,children

I think we are dealing with an issue where someone made millions and now doesn't care any longer about the plot or writing a book. The story could have been great and it is a great story but it is so rushed. It is just a money making scheme to capitalize on both the play and a book at the same time. I am still reading the ""book"" so these are my thoughts at this point. I can't blame her. I just think she is tired of the whole story and this is the attempt to add on to it without having to actually write a book. I just don't have any words for my disappointment.

The reason I'm giving it 2-stars instead of 1, is I knew what I was getting into when I bought this book, so it's not as if I was surprised it wasn't that good.

133821666X,2.0,No!!! Please don't make me give HP a low review :(,341,"I love Harry Potter - like have a Harry Potter tattoo and obsess over it kind of love. I'm also an English major who took multiple courses on reading plays of all kinds. So I am used to the set up and with amazing special effects could see this being entertaining to sit through just for nostalgia sake. However, it was bad. The plot was terrible. The characters were out of character by a lot... Doing things I didn't understand. It was insulting to read that something as silly as being embarrassed could turn Cedric into a death eater- his character was one of dignity, loyalty, and strength. To insinuate he could just have one embarrassing moment and end up being a death eater is unreal. Not to mention the giant plot hole of the time turner suddenly working in a way that it never has before (and in fact, was expressly written that it never could work in the way it does in Cursed Child). It read like a mediocre fan fiction written by someone who has only seen the movies. I was incredibly disappointed. If I was being more honest I would give this 1 star...

By giving her stamp of approval she was basically writing them a check. There is so much wrong with this story that I can't see how it would play out any better than what I read. It was horrible. The characters were out of character, the plot was not plausible, the timing was terrible. But even if I'd read a review like the one I'm writing I probably would have still read the story. I wouldn't be able to help myself because I love Harry Potter. The title of this play had such promise. The Cursed Child. How can you mess that up? The story almost writes itself. One question, what's the deal with the word ""learnt""? Is that a British thing? Oh well. Good for them I suppose. Maybe I'll write a play. Harry Potter and the Half Eaten Sandwich. Harry and Ron open their own detective agency and try to fight muggle crime.

133821666X,2.0,Honest Review (No Spoilers),1,"So I’m a huge HP fan and I put off reading this because everyone and their mother told me it was horrible. Honestly, it’s bad but not in the sense that everyone says. I hate that there are parts that make NO SENSE whatsoever and the fact that this book is cannon. It would’ve been better to call it a spin-off because a lot of the characters don’t act like themselves. A friend of mine pointed out that it’s like poorly written fan fiction and I’d have to agree. It could’ve been done better, but JK didn’t lead write this. She only gave the ok for it. Which isn’t any better, but you get the idea. Imo it’s worth the read just to say you read it, but it’s not nothing to make you want to read it over and over again.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Not what I hoped it would be.,1,"As a lifelong Harry Potter fan, I was very excited to read this story. Unfortunately, The Cursed Child somehow cheapened the story I grew up with. The original series played a huge role in my life, with the themes of friendship, teamwork, and love serving as meaningful life lessons in my teen years. The weight of the characters sacrifices, in my mind, deserves better then this cheeky script. The underlying story is a nice 'shout out' to Harry's past and the issue he's having with his son is appropriate, but the delivery itself is almost hyperbolic in a way that pokes fun at the whole thing. Especially poor Ron, whose character has clearly devolved into mere comedic relief. Its not a terrible little side read, but its not for those who were expecting or hoping for more of the powerful story we left behind nearly a decade ago.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Disappointing,1,"Very disappointing. I knew when I purchased this book that it wouldn't be a normal Harry Potter novel, yet I was unpleasantly surprised that none of the characters even remained true to themselves. Harry Potter, the boy who grew up with no family and whose hearts deepest desire was to have a family, suddenly becomes the kind of father who tells their child that he wished he weren't his son? Not to mention Hermione's (top student in her class every year of school) success in life now dependso on wether she and Ron end up dating? No. Just no. There are so many things wrong with the essentials in this story that it leads me to believe J.K. Rowling had zero part in writing this.",TRUE,children

The premise of the story was interesting though there were a few major questions left unanswered (no specifics to avoid spoilers). It was readable enough to finish. Overall it was not great, but also not the worst thing I’ve read.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Unfortunate,115,"I, just like countless millions around the globe, love all things Harry Potter, from the first day the first book was in my local bookstore through my nth re-read of the entire series, as well as watching all eight movies more times than I can admit. But then I read the new Harry Potter play/book and I hated it. I will ill try to say why without spoilers. The characters. We have spent over a decade watching Harry, Ron, Hermione and even Draco Malfoy mature from children int young but strong adults. Those are not the characters we will see in this play. In THIS play, Hermione is a shrew. And is employed in other than expected after reading Deathly Hallows, and after Rowlings' post-Potter interviews. This Hermione is NOT a nice lady. Treats her friends as underlings and her husband as she would an unwanted stray. With mange. Her brilliance has dimmed to a few riddles weak enough for the reader to get long before the protagonists. Harry is a workaholic who seems to have avoided his life since Book 7. His desk reflects his personal life, a mess. And his great, hard-won abilities in Defense Against Dark Arts? Not evident in this story. In fact, he seems weaker now than he was in his Triwizard Tournament days. And he, too, is barely tolerable. Not at all the sympathetic waif-turned-savior who we cared for, feared for, and many of us secretly wanted to be... And Ron. Poor Ron. Always the third in the trio. Harry had his Scar and his Destiny. Hermione had the brains. But Ron... Ron was their heart. Ron was no idiot - ""the best played game of chess"" from the first year days showed us that. But really, without him and his devotion to both Harry AND Hermione, Voldemort would have won. Ron was Harry's first, last, and best friend. And he was all that and more to Hermione. It was Ron, really, who taught Harry what love is. But here - here he is only the Comedy Relief. More pathetic than a three legged dog following the master who kicks him, he becomes less important, less interesting, and less credible as the same Ron Weasley we followed for seven years of his life. Luckily enough, they are really only background. The protagonists are Albus, Harry's middle child, and Scorpius, Draco's only child. Albus seems the main protagonist, but the story would go nowhere without Scorpius. Unfortunately, Albus is... Thoroughly unlikable. He lives in the permanent pity-party of a middle child raised in the showdown of a famous father. He divorces himself from his brother and cousin moments after the play begins. He creates his own misery, despite plenty of options. And Scorpius never fleshes out into more than a weak copy of both Ron and Hermione to Albus-as-Harry. Friend, but with definite suggestions that under the right circumstances, there could be more than friendship between the boys. And and almost all of Albus' troubles are his own immaturity (even taking his age into account) and his own self-pity, perhaps even self-hatered. Even his his attempts to undergo trials to better himself, to prove himself worthy to be a son to the Boy Who Lived... Well, unlike Harry, Albus seeks his own trouble, deliberately, with warning after warning, and nearly causes irreparable harm everyone he should have loved. So, yes. The characters were a let-down. The setting? Replace ""Hogwarts"" with ""the Tardis"" or ""the USS Enterprise"" and you do not change the story one iota. Just substitute ""sonic screwdriver"" or ""phasers"" for ""magic wand,"" as appropriate. And as for the plot: I basically told you that it is the story of a middle child of a famous and distant father who tries to find value in himself, but not in any good way. I won't mention plot devices, but let's just say this one has been so overused in the science fiction, fantasy, and even comic book literature of the past decade that there was no doubt that only the use of the Harry Potter name got this play produced in the first place. In short, there is nothing new. Nothing special. Nothing interesting. Just used plot devices and the destruction of characters the world has loved for nearly two decades to tell the story of an unlikeable, slightly spoiled, self-pitying boy with middle-child syndrome who, when offered a new life, a new chance, time and again held on to his daddy issues so hard that I, for one, only finished reading this play because I wanted to see how low it would sink. As a middle child myself, I had no pity for Albus. Rowling sold out on this one. Audiences will love to go back ""home"" to Hogwarts and our heroes (with a villain or two, or there is no conflict to resolve). But when they leave, and re-read the original books, re-watch the movies... How many will see the magic in this play was all in their own desire to get more time in a beloved world that ended with the Deathly Hallows?",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Disapointing and not up to the level of the series,,"If I considered The cursed Child as the last book of the series, I would rate it with a single star or less. Most of it is made up with the materials of the previous books and the story is predictable with a happy end. Characters are superficially developed and do not seem to have evolved much after nineteen years and even having fathered children…. This book is not relevant to the series. The only aspect that I have considered to give two stars is that it is not a book but a play and as such it cannot have the density nor the length of a true book as it was thought to be acted upon. This is the only redeeming fact in my opinion that can explain such a poor rendering of a sequel of Harry Potter’s books. If you can avoid the temptation to read something new of Potterverse, keep your money (it is far too expensive for what it is) and re-read the previous books. You’ll more satisfied and will see new elements that you did not see the first time and you’ll enjoy it much more than reading the cursed child which should be rather named “the cursed book”…",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,I feel duped,25,"Absolute disappointment. I feel like I was duped. I did very very little research on this. I knew it would be taking place 20 years down the road from the last books, and I knew it was technically just a screenplay, not an actual book. But I failed to realize it wasn't actually written by Rowling. I should have known, and I should have saved my money. Being that it was a screenplay I originally wrote it off, knowing it would likely to let me down, it would lack the depth I wanted. But the hype of release reeled me in, and the endless ads spouting, ""Harry Potter is back, read the eighth book"", lead me to buy the kindle edition so I could read it immediately. Oh what an utter waste of money. It is absolutely nothing like the originals, even if it was a proper book. None of the characters seem like themselves. I understand that they all have done some serious growing up, but it all seemed very out of touch. Only later did I find out that it would appear that Rowling didn't even have much of a hand in it. No wonder it sounded nothing like her originals. It really seemed like poor fan fic. It was so cheesy and childish, and just kept replaying old scenes, playing with time travel, making it so it was not original at all. It was so predictable. I kept trying to give it a break, telling myself that it's meant for the stage, it would probably be better there. But there were moments, that even on stage would have been terrible. To me, it's clear Rowling did not have much of a hand in this. It can not be put in the same line as the other books, and should not be considered part of the series at all. *** SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT *** One of my biggest issues was the gift Harry decides to gift Albus. Why oh why would a teenage boy want his dad's ratty old baby blanket? Really? It was just clear that was in there for the plot later on. It didn't make any sense whatsoever. So predictable. They go back in time to return and find one of their good friends was never born? How original. They go back in time to a dark world where evil prevailed? What a surprise. Never read a book where that sort of thing happened... Ugh. Lazy writing is what that is. And the bit with the trolly witch on the train? No other kid, Serious Black even, couldn't get past her, but Albus and Scorpius (oh and really, that name, Scorpius? While I loved the character, that name... I couldn't get past it) were able to jump off really without any problems. And come on. These two kids and a twenty year old girl could not have broken into Hermione's office and library so easily. Please. She was incredibly smart when she was a teenager. You are telling me, now, 20 years older, she doesn't have some impenetrable safe guards in place for her office? Or at least a more difficult riddle to crack. What a joke. She's smarter than that. Further so, I don't think Harry would have been such a terrible dad. I understand he didn't really have a ""dad"" to look up to, to guide him in his own path of being a parent, but I don't think he would have been this d-bag dad. And what was with Dumbledores breakdown? How awkward. Again, so out of touch with the original character. I need to go back and read the good stuff to cleanse my pallet of this atrocity.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,I Refuse To Acknowledge This As Part of the Series,2,"So disappointed. I'm a huge HP fan and have read the series over about 8 times. I understand that this is a script and reads differently than any of the books - I was expecting this and accounted for it. However, everything about this felt wrong. The characters did not embody the same traits as the original series and felt like different people altogether, the storyline was farfetched and flawed, and the writing was poor. The only redeeming quality of this book is that because is was so unlike the other books, that I finished it feeling like it wasn't a piece of the collection so I was able to completely disregard it. Definitely felt like fan fiction written by someone who didn't understand who the characters really were in the original series.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,The Curse of the fan fiction,7,"SPOILER FREE With 9 years, millions of works of fan fiction, a world of fan theories and wild shippings, since The Deathly Hallows, The Cursed Child is stepping into dangerous waters to call itself canon. So does it float? First, I really wish I could see the play – there’s so much in how a good actor can bring something to life that the page can’t capture, unless the playwright has the sparkling wit of Oscar Wilde. And unfortunately, Thorne doesn’t. While a few characters do shine on the page, many feel off. As a “canon” sequel, this play could have taken the Harry Potter story, for better or worse, in some new direction. Instead, it chooses to play it safe and function as a curtain call of old favorites rather than exploring new ground. That’s both a positive and a negative. The story as a story suffers for it, but those same choices also serve to insulate the Harry Potter the world grew up with from any changes or damage a sequel could do. So while it doesn’t add anything new or wonderful to the story, it also doesn’t really detract from the original either. It just is. But is it worthwhile? The best parts of the story are with the characters who are wholly new to the story – or at least one in particular. He’s a bright point of dry humor and a bucket of cold water on the obligatory-angst-filled pity parties many of the other characters indulge in. And then there are the cameos. And depending on who your favorite witches or wizards were, you may more or less enjoy them. One had me as excited as possible, and it was handled really, really well. (That means me literally dancing around my kitchen with my Kindle.) There are the inside jokes – though there could have been more – and the intentional? unintentional? references to famous works of fan fiction. There were the obligatory deus ex machina moments, some heavy handed character growth dialogue (what can you do with the short space of a play?) There were also some meaningful conversations about growing up. All the same, I wish they would have marketed it as a “one off” rather than a “eighth story.” I know, I know, people wouldn’t have bought it otherwise, but still. It made the moments of incongruity more jarring and annoying than they would have been otherwise. Because, with or without JKR’s input, yes, there are moments in the play where real, important details from the books are either glossed over, shrugged at or ignored. Not little side things. Things that are key to the play’s conclusion and are a big deal in the books. The kind of things that render this play *not* canon, no matter what they say. So my conclusion? It was fun. I’m glad I read it. But if you please, I’ll be the judge of what I care to consider “real” and those things I’ll shrug off as fan fiction. Because, quite honestly, that’s mostly what this is. I’ll take Scorpius though. Scorpius makes this worth reading. I’ll very gladly add his character to canon. ******A final note: *don’t* read the HP books before reading this. Start with this, and let this play launch you back into the much superior world of the books. This would be a lame note to end on after all that. In fact, I think that’s what I’m going to go read next……",TRUE,children

That made me question whether this play was written in a true effort to continue the story, or rather to further profit from the Harry Potter name. Rating 3 stars because, sure, I love Harry Potter and I did get more character insight and a further sense of closure from this.

133821666X,2.0,NOT Harry Potter 8 !,3,"What this reads like to me is a rough outline of what should have been a whole new series of Harry Potter novels - which Mrs. Rowling couldn't be bothered to actually write, so she handed the draft off to a couple of theater guys, who crammed 4 or 5 books into 1 and called it a 'play'. The tensions between Harry and his son alone would have made an excellent novel 8 in the series, before we even get back to Hogwarts. Things like character development, layering of plot lines and the building of interest are lost arts in literature (and even more so in movies and TV !), but Mrs. Rowling is quite capable, her other books are proof of that. Not sure why she took the VERY easy way out on this one. Many of the characters are basically caricatures of their original selves, the plot has more holes than thinly sliced Swiss cheese, the whole thing's kind of a mess. It's ok if you look at it as a potential theater production, which has to be shortshort by necessity - can't keep the audience in the theater for 3 weeks - but it should come with a neon pink warning label : THIS IS FAN FICTION, NOT J.K.

I understand that this is the script for a play, but the things that I didn't like are basic story elements. Those elements might be covered up by glitz and explosions when you see it on stage, but they were my biggest grievance. I do not like how time travel is used in this book. Time travel was done so well in the Harry Potter series. The rules introduced here seem so arbitrary and don't make sense. It seems more like a way to show scenes and characters that the audience will enjoy. The tacked on romance at the end is so stupid. The Harry Potter series gets flack for the relationships set up late in the series, but Rowling did an excellent job of writing friendship. This book is the opposite. It writes a budding romantic relationship so well, but it calls it just a friendship in the end. There are good things this book did. Slytherin was shown in a different light. Complexities of adulthood and the difficulties of parenthood were shown well. I wanted so much from this book so maybe I am being unfair in my critique, but I give this book a 2/5. I absolutely want to see this play. I may even read this book again, but I don't think it is good. The rating is also comparing it to the standard I have for all things Harry Potter.",TRUE,children

Other than that, it's a play, written as a play, read as a play, which was fine.

I was very much looking forward to learning about the next Potter generation, but this reads more like fan fic. And sadly, now that this is released, it's part of the Potter cannon and can't be changed. Sigh. Maybe it might be better if watched on stage than just reading the script???

I don't accept the fact that because of this is play it needs to support by actual play. When I read Shakespeare, I never needed to see play to understand characters' struggle, joy or regrets.

So I was hesitant to read ""the cursed child"". The problem with most sequels is that they can tarnish the original - and wouldn't that be awful. While I don't think the ""Cursed child"" ruins the original series...it does stain some of the very best parts of goblet of fire. Dead characters are brought back to life (briefly). I really wanted to like this book and did the best I could to see through the screenplay style but the plot falls short. Our favorite characters are reduced to one-dimensional versions of themselves. The only way I got through this book was the pretend it was just bad fan fiction. The one redeeming quality of the book is the ending. The whole first 90% had me shaking my head and genuinely disliking our protagonist (Albus Potter is kind of a jerk!)

Beyond that, I continue to read the books just about every other year. You could say that I'm a touch obsessed. That being said, I was super excited for this and waited eagerly for it to come out. In retrospect, it could have been my anticipation and expectation for the script that made it come across as just...not the greatest to me. This script read like a poorly written fan fiction, to be blunt about it. The number of plot holes and the lack of any sort of complexity beyond the weird bending of the scenes made this just poorly executed. I really wanted to like it and at parts I did, but there were just some certain things that I couldn't get past, such as: - Why Harry was a horrible father to one of his children as opposed to being a great father - Why Harry was so generally out of character during the entire play - Why Hermione was written to be so miserable if she was without Ron at her side - Where is Teddy? Did he want to be excluded from this narrative he did not ask to be in? And in addition to that, where's Hugo? Or Rose? Or James? Where are the other children in this? - Heteronormativity (or at least what seems to be heteronormativity) Overall, this book was pretty upsetting to read and try as I might, I just didn't entirely like it. If you're a fan, you're still probably dying to read it if you haven't already. Personally I don't find it to be very canon what with all the plot holes and the out of character-ness, nor do I think it deserves to call itself the eighth story.

There's no real development of the new characters or their personal interactions and dynamics. There's no real basis for the plot and most scenes are simply retreads of former Harry potter scenes. The antagonist comes out of nowhere, with no real back story. Much of the dialogue feels forc4ed and characters make cameo appearances for no reason. Very weak.",TRUE,children

133821666X,2.0,Weak Plot,32,"My review is going to sound strikingly similar to the preceding reviews. 1.) I was fully aware Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play rather than a book, but was still willing to read it. A play doesn't have the same opportunity to create complex characters as a book, so it seems that new characters are just dropped into the plot. These characters are complete strangers to the readers and contribute nothing to the plot other than a few lines. 2.) I understand this is a play and it must move along to keep the showtime reduced, but as a reader, it seems like the plot moves extremely quickly. The speed at which the plot moves does not allow for the authors to share details about how characters arrived to their emotional state, or provide a sequence of events that led to a current event in the story. A scene that would have taken a chapter in a book takes a few pages of dialogue and narrations. 3.) The authors of this book do not seem to know the original Harry Potter characters. The characters are all 20-something years older than what would have been their 7th/final year at Hogwarts. I know people change over the course of 20-25 years, but the characters seem to be different people. The way they react to situations and their interactions with each other are not consistent with the characters we knew. I don't want to include a spoiler, but upon finding out a character's true identity, I essentially rolled my eyes. 4.) Last, but not least, the plot is weak. The only person that should be writing a Harry Potter book is J.K. Rowling. As an avid Harry Potter reader, I believe I know the characters very well. However, the only person that really knows them is their creator, J.K. Rowling. Lets leave it to the pro people! After reading this play, I have zero desire to see the play myself.",TRUE,children

To put it nicely, it was a huge disappointment. It didn't read like any of the rest of the Harry Potter series, and not because it was a script - I wonder how much Rowling actually wrote. There were a few (a very few) interesting parts; none of the characters had much depth to them; the original characters weren't themselves; there was very little (if anything) to take you into the ""world of Potter""; the storyline was not well thought out; there was a huge detachment from the original series (and not because so many years have passed);...

The magical world almost makes sense, and really seems real because there are no discrepancies. This book is missing everything but the action! It's exploiting Harry Potter's name just for the fans to buy the book that is not worthy of its title! The characters are very flat and shallow. They are not realistic, and there is no character development.

(SPOILER: How did transfiguring Harry into Voldemort not turn him into Voldermort? How did the message stay on the blanket after all those years - was the blanket never washed? How did Lily Sr. even let them write the message on the blanket? How did they see James Sr., Lily Sr., and Harry if they were under the Fidelius Charm? How did it help to disarm Cedric during the first task - someone would have returned his wand!

133821666X,2.0,Disappointed!!!,12,"Unfortunately I had very high hopes for this play. However, it seems that J.K. Rowling simply did not have enough money and trusted the wrong people to revamp the franchise. The play lacks any of the intrigue and mystery that grew the franchise. While it is hard to put all of the intrigue and detail into a script rather than a book, to release this story in this way is indeed careless. Instead of breaking new ground and giving the characters new battles and people to fight, we are left with tired characters that have little life. Why in the world would a man who ""never knew love"" have a child? The entire premise of book was the Voldermort was a cold, unloving person who cared so little about love that he split his soul into seven (unknowingly 8) pieces. We are truly left to believe that upon resurrection while he was in the few years that was not trying to stop Harry Potter he stopped to have a child. Why not move on from Voldermort and find a new villain? The real world is full of new threats just as the make believe world should be as well. Imagine the depth and development a new character could bring, but instead we are left fighting old and now tired story-lines. The story starts out with a wonderful premise of a Potter being sorted into Slytherin, but then ends up being a time traveling mess after that. If you want a great time changing story, I would suggest Back to the Future. Also one would think that a character who grew up without a family would be more sympathetic to the plight of a sad child. All in all, I would say skip this version which apparently was written to people more interested in making money than expanding the franchise. I wish I could recommend this book, but do know that once you read this book you cannot remove the stain it has brought to the franchise.",TRUE,children

Harrys character was acceptable, although I would have loved to have seen him be an aurora. With the new characters, there was weak character development and the plot was very predictable.

133821666X,2.0,A Puzzling Story,2,"On the one hand, it's good to revisit the Hogwarts universe, and diehard fans will find themselves unable to resist the opportunity to do so. The themes of how our histories can continue to haunt us despite our best efforts are interesting to explore. That said, I find it hard to believe Rowling would allow this adaptation of her material to go forward. It offers an incredibly superficial treatment of those themes in a frenetic plot that features key characters constantly running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The worst element of this story is how it turns Ron Weasly into a complete fool . . . in every incarnation. Though he is supposedly an auror AND inexplicably running George's joke shop, he never has anything better to do than pop in at Hogwarts. While I grant that Ron was never the character with the greatest depth, he wasn't a complete and total fool--there was a reason why Hermione loved and married him. Albus and Scorpius are funny and echo the original trio in important ways, and it's interesting to consider what it would be like to be the son of the famous harry potter. Draco Malfoy is surprisingly the only character who gets any depth, but it doesn't always ring true. When he tells Harry how his father disapproved of his marriage, one has to wonder why Lucius Malfoy was walking around free to harass his son when readers have to assume that all surviving death eaters were surely thrown into Azkaban. Readers are also likely to find the play format frustrating, but you have to take it as it is. I would not say I regret reading it, but it's definitely not worth full hardback price, even from Amazon. If you're OK with eating a cheap fastfood burger when you crave red meat, then read it. I say that seriously, not sarcastically: sometimes we take what we can get in the face of a serious craving. However, this book, like the burger, seems unlikely to provide much satisfaction.

Not only that, but Albus acted like nothing more than a spoiled, entitled brat... The namesake of Dumbledore deserved to be written so much better and fitting of the namesake.

133821666X,2.0,A note of discord in the HP Canon,5,"I feel like The Cursed Child is a very polarizing work. You either love it or you hate it. Given that Harry Potter is such an important part of so many people's lives, the reaction is understandable. I'm very sad to say that I'm firmly in the negative camp. I wanted to love TCC so much. I was so excited to see an extension to one of my favorite stories. I remember how exciting it was, back in the day, to wait for new Harry Potter books to come out and then devour them in one night, screaming and cheering and crying as these characters I loved so much made their way through their world. I wanted so badly to experience even a sliver of that feeling once again. I picked up the Kindle version of the book with hesitant excitement -- finally, I would get to know just how everybody fared in the end. The answer to that question was: poorly. Now, I realize that JKR only had a slight hand in this manuscript. It really shows. So many characters felt stilted or wrong. The dialog, which should have been the book's shining light, fell flat most of the time. I tried to imagine it being read out loud by skilled actors and that only made it slightly more palatable. The majority of the new characters felt as flat and undeveloped as a newborn Sim, random attributes thrown together in the hopes that something would stick and come alive. The only exception, for me, was Scorpius, who still managed to have a bit of a heartbeat despite the lousy writing surrounding him. The story was also silly. It was a silly story. It read like try-hard fanfiction to me, like a soup with too many ingredients. One particular twist in the story was so unbelievable -- in a bad way -- that I found myself staring up from my book on the subway, as if on The Office, gaping at an imaginary camera. I have since read impassioned defenses of this twist that have convinced me that there may, in fact, have been the slightest sliver of canonical defense for it, but, no, it still read as ludicrous to me and completely out of harmony with the world of the original seven books. In short -- I did not enjoy TCC, but you might, and I hope you do. For many reasons, it didn't work for me.",TRUE,children

But what fascinates me the most is Ms. Rowling's ability to tell a great story. She has an adeptness at story telling that is masterful and all encompassing. Her books transport you into the environments as well as the emotional/mental realities of her characters. By the end of a book, you feel that her characters could be real people and you care what happens next. Unfortunately, the Cursed Child is missing her literary touch. I think part one had traces of it, as if she had some say in the initial character development. I was ready for the original motion picture cast to come back to the big screen (I was then brought back to earth when they reintroduce one of my favorite characters whose actor counterpart is no longer with us 😢. Talk about a crash landing...). The second part, though, just feels rushed and half baked; like a quick wrap up versus the ""let's bring it on home"" an epic deserves (Think Jurassic Park 2 versus Aliens). Being released in script format means that readers are going to have to do a lot of the ""magic"" themselves, something Ms. Rowling's fans are not used to doing. I hope that she decides to take the basics of this dialogue and creates a true 8th edition to the Harry Potter series.

It seemed recycled and unnecessary, key points of the plot things very unlikely to happen. Frankly, the only reason I see J.K.

It crumbles under the limitation of a short play, the long span of time in the books, with the characters and plot developments and tangents is missing. The plot that is available is as if someone wanted to push a storyline that was separate from Harry Potter in Harry Potter, using a time travel concept that forces the story to work on past events instead of creating anything new.

I realized going into this that it was a stage script, and would therefore be missing many of the things that made the books so wonderful, as well as the somewhat constricting sense of space that plays tend to have. What I did not expect was such a poorly thought out plot. Spoilers ahead. I really thought this was going to be a story about the next generation, and while there were some new characters, this was a rehash of old ground...literally. It is all about time travel. I am not a huge fan of the time travel conundrum. It has been done many times, and certainly better than this foray into it. Introducing this element to the Harry Potter franchise in general is very problematic. I realize there was some of this in the stories already, but not to the extent that this one goes to. One of the other issues is that the whole adventure is such an unbelievable premise (bringing back Cedric Diggory) and out of character for these newly established characters that it is commented on by the other characters in the play. Sloppy writing. One of the worst examples of the sloppily written plot is the alternate universe where Snape is still around. First, there is no explanation as to why he survived, when the wand problem would have still existed (why he died to begin with), nor is there explanation as to why Voldemort et. al. still trust him and why he is palling around with Ron and Hermione, when they still would not know why he killed Dumbledore. I'm sure there could be some explanation, but none is given. It seemed like it was just an excuse to bring the character back. I loved Snape as much as the next person, but this did nothing to further his character and I would have rather they left him in his grave. All in all, I'm sure this is much better seen as a play, and they probably should not have released the script for that reason. I'm sure as you experience it, some of these things might be less important to just being in that world again and seeing it, but I can't imagine that the spectacle can entirely confund one from recognizing the bad writing beneath it.",TRUE,children

But there are just too many problems. First, I realize this is a play—just stage directions and scene notes and dialogue. So right off you're not going to get the beautiful, rich prose of J. K. Rowling. And it will be clipped—there isn't time in a play (even a 5 hour, two-part play) for all of the little details that Rowling is able to weave together in her novels. But this felt like bad fan-fiction. Most scenes were 1 1/2 to 3 pages long. Things jumped all over the place and felt disjointed. A play was definitely not the right forum for this story. Second, characters did and said things that are inconsistent with the characters Rowling gave us in her seven books. I did not believe most of the characters. Third, the plot kept getting more twisted and convoluted and soap opera-y. The structure, symbolism, and relatability of the seven books were thrown out the window. On a positive note, there were some redeemable themes that we come to expect and love from J. K. Rowling. Themes of love, trust, acceptance, and redemption are touched upon. I loved the fact of the central, unexpected friendship. I didn't love the journey they took, but the fact of the friendship was beautiful to me. And there was more understanding and acceptance at the end. Overall I'm glad I read it. But I probably won't need to read it again. And I definitely don't count this work as Harry Potter canon.

The characters do and say things that they would never do in the books, and the dialog is not true to who they are in the books. The plot is confused and pointless at times.

I realize that this story focuses less on our beloved characters and more on their offspring. Unfortunately, even these new characters seemed one dimensional and undeveloped. The plot was... Meh, somewhat predictable. Overall I was just disappointed. If anything, this makes me want to re-read the actual series again.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Not at all what I was expecting...,,"I can't really blame J.K. Rowling for me not doing my research off course. But I read a newspaper article that said that a new Harry Potter novel was out, which was BASED on a play... For once I didn't read a sample (because hey, it's Harry Potter, what could go wrong?), and bought the pretty expensive 'novel'. It's not a novel. It's literally the play that is written down, to see what I mean, open the sample! While this was a decent enough story for a play, and I would like to see it in a movie, it is not and will never be, a novel. Plays are meant to be watched, not read, which this 'book' makes perfectly obvious. Conclusion: would love to see the play, or watch a movie about it, but does not at all compare to a real Harry Potter novel (or any other kind of novel actually).",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,If you've read a lot of bad to mediocre Fan Fics this feels like one of those.,,"Comes of more like a fanfic reliving childhood goodness. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Jack Thorne hasn't read the novels and only sat through the movies. Can't even play by its own rules much less the ones set up in the books. Fair warning I'm going to spoil everything. So they're using a knockoff time turner that can send you back but only for five minutes. Fair enough but then they get sent to Godric's hollow 1981 and suddenly they're stuck there. What happened to the time limit? Everyone seriously just forgets about it. So whatever through the power of pulling things out of the authors bum they send a message to the present. Conveniently it works and Malfoy conveniently has another time turner to save them. But Albus and Scorpius don't even know Malfoy has it. They're acting on information they don't have. They have no plan for what to do after contacting the present and it works out anyway. But whatever harry and crew arrive and decide to disguise one of themselves as Voldemort in order to capture his daughter. (99) I seriously rolled my eyes when Voldemort has a daughter was revealed it's the dumbest, most hackneyed obvious thing to do for a villain so of course they did that. Anyway they polyjuice potion them some Voldemort. Point A polyiuice takes about a month to make This isn't isn't some little point only a diehard fan would know, but a fairly significant part of chamber of secrets. Point B you need a bit of someone to make polyjuice, Who the heck was carrying Voldemort's finger nails around for nineteen year!

133821666X,2.0,"This is fan fiction, not canon - can I pretend I never read it?",2,"I made the mistake of thinking Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was written by J.K. Rowling. It is not. And even though it’s supposed to have been based off a short story by Rowling, and it appears she has sanctioned this play, I was very disappointed in this book. Some Background My husband and I are both HUGE Harry Potter fans. We read the series out loud together early in our dating life (and then later when the last book came out), and we’ve listened to the audiobooks numerous times since then – together and apart. (I’d previously read the first 3 books in the series in college and re-read them all as each new book came out.) When this play was announced, I originally wanted to go to London this summer for one of the early shows. Knowing that was a little crazy, I instead pre-ordered the script when it was announced. I knew we’d have to read this play together – just like old times. The Format The play itself isn’t hard to read. It’s mostly dialog which is my favorite part of many books anyway. It was a little tricky to read aloud because unless my husband was looking over my shoulder, I had to read the character names before reading their lines. I don’t do voices. The Good There’s very little I liked about the play. In fact, I’d like to pretend I never read it. I am going to treat it the same way I treat the one fan fiction book I read a couple of years ago, like just that – fan fiction. Even though Rowling gave the idea for this story, I am not going to treat it as canon. That being said, I was happy with the jobs that Harry, Hermione, and Ginny ended up with. Ron, not so much. One of the additional things I wanted from the epilogue at the end of book 7 was to know what careers the main characters ended up in. And Albus and Scorpius were really cute. I liked this new generation friendship. Their banter reminded me of Ron and Hermione in the earlier books. And that’s about it. The Bad Without giving anything away, I will say the following: - The original characters seemed really out of character. Draco was about the most believable. - I hate time travel stories that mess with the original plot line. If it didn’t always happen that way, then it’s not possible. This book changed too many things, too many times. - They messed with the way some magical things worked. Time turners don’t need to be touched; they need to be around the people’s necks. Polyjuice potion isn’t brewed overnight, and it requires a hair of the person you’re transforming into. For me, Harry Potter has always been about the details, and they messed with the details with this play. - Harry is married to Ginny now. Hermione to Ron. Ron and Ginny should not have been on the outside of all of the action. Their marriages were too flat. - And the big reveal about Delphi? No. Just no. I didn’t buy it. Conclusion This play probably makes a better play. If I’d seen it live first, I think I would have just loved seeing the characters brought to life – new and old. I wouldn’t have cared so much about the story (maybe). But reading it as “the eighth Harry Potter” book was just a mistake. Sadly, that’s what I did, and my opinions and rating reflect that misconception. [...]",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Poorly done.,,"I'll keep this brief. I'm giving this 2 stars, and I feel like that's being pretty generous. I have been a Harry Potter fan for 18 years. I grew up with these books. I was extremely excited to read this, but I ended up feeling completely let down. The characters were poorly written and not true to the cannon books. The plot was bumpy, predictable, and unimaginative. I felt that the pacing was off, and the ending just felt....forced and hokey. I just felt that this book did a terrible job honoring the characters that I grew up loving. I agree with other reviews that have said this: no one should write these characters except for J.K. Rowling herself.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Like a portrait of a deceased Headmaster,3,"First and foremost let me say that I am just one individuals opinion, really if you are a lover of the Harry Potter by any means I think you should very much consider reading this script. My heart soared at the prospect of continuing on the story of our beloved characters created by J.K., it was very pleasant to be immersed back into the wizardry world. However that being said I highly doubt that I will ever pick this up again, unlike the other 7 books that I have read time and time again. Many questions that we were all dying to know were in fact answered, but unfortunately I found myself reading just to find out what happens rather than being utterly bewitched by an unfolding plot. At several moments I found myself questioning the actions of the characters that didn't seem to ring true to the dispositions that was so clearly and thoughtfully painted in the original series. Yes I understand that 19 years has passed and time and starting families will change an individual but they seemed to be acting out of character. The plot itself wasn't even half of the quality that I've seen displayed, to be frankly honest if felt as if I was reading mediocre fanfiction. While I loved revisiting familiar places and faces it was a disappointment. By all means I believe potential readers should purchase it and for out for themselves. To me I found it to be as McGonagall explained the Headmaster Portrait's don't even represent half of their subjects and are not to be mistaken as the actual thing.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,I wish I borrowed from a friend. Very short (1 day) book.,,"I did not still expect the same quality of story as Rowling, but I was still surprised at how terrible the story was. I feel like the writers and publishers had to do some serious convincing and bargaining to get her to sign off on this. This may not be the case publicly, but surely she wasn't impressed with the writing. It was the most cliched and cheesy father-son story I've ever read (granted I never read cheesy father-son stories). This was like some cartoon reboot version of the original series with not-so-brief (thankfully) cameos from the original characters. I don't want to spoil the details, but you need the details to understand how corny this book was. So I'll leave you with this small voice in your head that's saying ""told ya so"" for when you inevitably buy this book anyway because you're a Harry Potter fiend and you'd read the manuscript for the next story off of used toilet paper if you had to.",TRUE,children

Couldn't wait to read this book, but it was just awful. I have read the premise too many times in too many stories and the dialogue was so simplistic that it became unbearable. If JK Rowling really wrote this, she should be ashamed. The writing was so bad it was like she penned it over a morning coffee. Looking up the reviews for the play now, but I doubt they will be any better than this ""story"". Sorry, Harry Potter lovers, this one is a stinker.",TRUE,children

The entire storyline was so outlandish and implausible that it seemed like a feeble attempt at a fanfiction. The lines and behavior of many of the characters seemed so unauthentic. The plot was so outlandish and made no sense when you consider the timeline of events in the original series. The only real redeeming aspects were how surprisingly likable Scorpius Malfoy is, and the random cameos and/or mentions from quite a few past characters. It pains me to say this, especially as someone who has been in love with this series and franchise since the very first book came out in 1998 (could it really be 18 years already??) but I wish someone could cast a memory charm on me so I don't know this story exists.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Sigh.,"5,627","Let me start by saying this, I love harry potter. I read the books 2-3 times per year since I was a child. I've grown up with these books. These books are a part of me, I've named my children after characters in these books. I have 3 tattoos, all of which are harry potter. I'm a dedicated fan, entirely obsessed to be candid. I have waited for this book like the rest of you. I can handle the fact that it's written as a play, I was expecting this. I was fully prepared to accept this. I waited all night for this to be released to my kindle (it's 3 a.m and I've just finished). I sped through the cursed child and my final thought was, this was disappointing . I'm skeptical of how much jk rowling actually contributed to this. I get more of a harry potter vibe from the fantastic beasts trailer than this entire book. The plot was bad, almost everything was bad. It was like a poorly written fanfic. It sucks that I'm saying this because harry potter is a part of soul. I went into this thinking it was everything I'd ever hoped for. I'm not saying don't buy the book, by all means buy it. Read it. See for yourself. I'm not being cynical, rowling is the queen of my world. This is the first and likely only bad review I will give regarding her. Just be warned, this does not feel like harry potter. This was not intricate, well excuted, thought out, or clever. The characters were not true to themselves. I think the best way to go into reading this and saving yourself from despair is to read it as a fanfic and not the true works of rowling. It would be tolerable had her name not been involved, I expected so much more. And now I will try to purge this book from my memory and continue to live in her past works of art.

133821666X,2.0,Nostalgia: Yes. Sequel: No.,6,"Dear Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: It's not you, it's me. Actually... never mind, it's you. Look, obviously as a fan (and I mean a super die-hard fan who still reads the books at least once... okay twice... per year), you HAVE to read this. You can't possibly not buy it or pretend it doesn't exist. And you know what? For what it is - a play based on what I fully deem as fan-fiction - it's not half bad. I'm sure the production is decent, the story itself is okay in that context... but beyond that, it's just ""meh."" The timeline is too speedy. In rushing through Albus' first few years at Hogwarts, we lose ALL of the magic of the story, and all of the character development. Again, this is a play, so I get why they had to do it this way... but it's just so out of step with JK Rowling that it left me feeling no connection with the main characters. Also, I was disappointed with the adult versions of our beloved characters, who really seemed but a shadow of who they were. I just didn't find them believable at all, which was extremely frustrating. After getting to know those characters so well, it seems like the play writers really didn't know them at all. As if they had only scratched the surface of who these characters are. The larger problem, of course, is that we all so desperately want a sequel. A real, honest, true sequel - because we can't let the world of Harry Potter go. Unfortunately, unless JK Rowling herself were to author another full-fledged, epic series of tomes to accomplish that, with all the magic and character development and just sheer amazingness of the first series (no pressure)... well, let's be honest, nothing less than that will ever be good enough. It can't be. And yes, that probably is coloring my opinion and rating here. But, the Harry Potter world is too rich, the story too full of magic and imagery, the characters too real... The Cursed Child is a play, and it can be read in 3-4 hours easily. It's simply not possible for this to come close to what it is we all truly desire. So where does that leave us? Adjust your expectations for this. Then, adjust them again. I originally wrote here that this is/should be considered a companion book to the original series, and nothing more... but really, I think it may be even less than that. It really is just fan-fiction that someone condensed down into a play. At least, that's what I'm going to tell myself. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go pick up The Sorcerer's Stone and a pint of ice cream, dream about how JK Rowling has TOTALLY been writing a real sequel all this time (details for which will of course be released any day now), and forget this ever happened by embarking on another round of reading the entire original series for the millionth time.",TRUE,children
133821666X,2.0,Giant plot holes,5,"So this was enjoyable to read. But it was enjoyable as vaguely interesting fanfic rather than a legitimate part of the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed the characters but they weren't very complex and they were rather flat. Honestly my biggest issue with the play was the plot. So prepare yourself for SPOILERS!!! None of the plot makes sense because it involves using a Time Turner to travel back in time and change the past- which is not how time travel works in Harry Potter. It is very well established that when you go back in time using a Time Turner you do not change the time line- in fact the fact that you went back in time has always been part of the time line. Much like time travel in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. This is fairly crucial to the plot of Book 3 because Harry knows he can produce a patronus and get rid of the dementors because he has already experienced this the first time. If time travel worked the way it does in this play Harry would have been kissed by the dementors and never had the opportunity to go back in time and do anything- it would have been the end of the series. Furthermore, it would defeat the purpose of Hermione having the time turner in the first place because she would have created an alternate reality every time she went back in time and chose to go to a different class. It would have been unimaginable chaos. END SPOILERS So I'm glad I read it, but all in all I think I could write something better and I'm not really that great at writing I just read the Harry Potter books a lot more than these authors apparently did.",TRUE,children

Put all that information in one place, a novel. I do like that she wrote the screen play for Fantastic Beasts, it's an interesting premise and steamed from the the kind of writing I just put down, but it took a long time for a good idea to come from this. She just gave the play write a few tips then added her name to this project it seems. Ron is like movie Aron in this play, Heromine was cold, Harry would never have said what he did, he would be the best Father ever since he never had family until now, and sure fine go back in time or to a portrait to get yourself a Snape or Dumbledore moment, but why flash back to Hagrid multipul times yet never see him, ya'll know he would be around.

133821666X,2.0,"Wait for the movie, or go to a library if you must",1,"In short: the delivery and condition was fine, but the book wasn't great. In long(er): My girlfriend has the trunk-style boxed set of all the original Harry Potter books (she is quite the HP fan). I'm 26, and it wasn't until last summer that I finally read any Harry Potter books. I am an avid reader, just never got around to them, didn't see what all the fuss was about. Then I read them, and instantly fell for the writing style. (If you like Sherlocky stories, check out Rowling's Cormoran Strike detective series under her pseudonym Robert Galbraith.) She's such a detailed writer, already one of my favorites; her details are so vivid, her descriptions come to life in ink. My girlfriend had been on the waiting list for this book from the get. A new Harry Potter book? Score! We both read it in a matter of days. It wasn't at all what we expected. First off, it's manuscript style (remember those Shakespeare plays in high school? right...). I don't mind that, because dialogue is very important in any story. However, it loses details that you love with a book--there are no thoughts or internal monologues and no detailed background, except for the clunky one-person-is-explaining-to-the-dimwitted-other dialogue format. Second, I was acutely aware throughout that I was reading a ready-for-performance story. Every character is described enough to get an idea of general features, but vague enough that I couldn't pinpoint any specific trait (e.g. Harry's goofy hair, Ron's red hair, McGonagall's always-on stern expression). It's clear to me that they were writing this story to avoid pigeonholing themselves in future casting. Basically any one person can be every character in the play--which is great for aspiring actors, but less so for those of us just trying to get lost in a story. Third, the action was written for a play, which relies heavily on visuals in some scenes. ""Epic wand battle"" isn't enough for the lover of the scene breakdown. That's not an exaggeration, that is an actual quote (though now I can't find it to reference, so I hope I'm accurate). Fourth, the ending was abrupt at best. Without giving much away, I'll simply say this: the whole book is filled with the anticipation of rising and rising and rising action, and finally at the climax, it's just done. Even in Scooby Doo the final plan goes at least a bit wrong. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop until I realized it was already over, and we cut to epilogue-grade garbage for the last two scenes. If you must must must read this book, check it out from a library or borrow it from a friend, it's not worth the purchase. If you can, wait until the movie comes out, which I'm sure will happen eventually. PS. Though JK Rowling gets bolded first bill, the story actually was a collaboration between three people and the manuscript itself was written by one of the other collaborators. I think that's part of the reason it is so stylistically different from the other books. I also am not sure how much of this is Rowling's work rather than being a glorified ""fanfic"" written by two guys who were fortunate enough to have input from the original creator.",TRUE,children

The sentences are abrupt and short; almost like reading hurried text messages. I want my final memories of Harry Potter to end with the Deathly Hallows where the ending was stated as ""All was well."" I certainly don't want it to be on a dimly lit stage, centered around a weak plot story line, where the final words shared are ""So do I. The End.""

Perhaps I'd enjoy it more if I watched it live. Anybody else feel a bit unimpressed? I'd still recommend it since it's a pretty short/fast read and it's interesting to see J.K.

133821666X,2.0,Harry Potter and the Cursed Book: Mediocre fanfiction.,2,"You know those fanfiction stories you read where you start off thinking they're going to be good, but slowly realize that they were probably written by a 12 year old who is obsessed with cheesy dialogue and emo-ness, and wouldn't know a good plot if it hit them in the face? That is what this is. It's a bit harsh, but I honestly couldn't help thinking this while reading, without ever having seen another review. The plot revolves around Harry Potter's son, Albus, dealing with the insecurities and ""consequences"" of being the hero of the wizarding world's son. A rift is sown between father and son that continues to grow, despite Harry's best intentions, leading to a series of unfortunate events, beginning with Albus using a time-turner to go back in time to attempt to change the past along with his best friend Scorpius, and the mysterious newcomer, Delphi Diggory. Albus gets more than he bargained for when his meddling sets off a butterfly effect of negative changes to the future. Now he has to try to correct his mistake and save the future, while unaware of the dangers around him.... It sounds interesting enough, but it somehow falls short. The characters are 2 dimensional and out of character. The dialogue and plot are watered down and unrealistic/unbelievable. And great Scott, there are SO many plot holes. I guess I just expected something different. I wanted to go back to Hogwarts and watch Albus grow from there. I wasn't completely against them revisiting scenes from the previous books, because I was curious to see them (briefly) played out in a different way, or as a means to show Albus glimpses of his father's life to give him a different perspective about him. However, I would have much preferred a look into Albus' life at Hogwarts, along with Scorpius, to really understand him and his issues, not a fast-forward synopsis of his life and first 4 years in Hogwarts, minimizing his issues and making it hard to relate to him. Don't get me wrong, there is still good here, but just so much wrong. Let's go now to the specifics: BIG SPOILERS ahead: Good Points: 1. I actually liked seeing this more gentle and affectionate Ron. People might compare him to the movie version, but I think this is in line with what a more grown-up Ron would be like (although maybe a bit more hot-tempered). I think surviving the war, marrying the love of his life, having children, losing Fred, and having overcome his most of his insecurities would mellow him out. 2. Hermione and Ron together. Even in the alternate realities where they weren't always ""together,"" they still loved each other. They're meant to be. 3. Scorpius- how can you not like him? The most likeable character in the play. He has the intelligence/geekiness of Hermione, the positivity of Luna, and the heart of Neville. What's not to like? 4. Scorpius and Rose. Their relationship served as another way to bring together the most opposing houses in Hogwarts. And knowing that Draco had a thing for Hermione makes it better because it's the realization of what could never be, in a positive way. Negative Points: 1. The dialogue was simplistic, robbing the characters of life and personality, and yet somehow, still making them seem out of character. What happened to the clever Hermione? The feisty and strong-headed Ginny? The calm and wise Dumbledore? And Harry? I don't think Harry would have ever said that to Albus, nor would he have acted like a total jerk and dictator and prevented him from seeing Scorpius. 2. The ""issue"" between Albus and Harry. I could have really understood how being Harry's son could be a problem, unfortunately the way it played out was so poorly done it sometimes felt illogical. Maybe it's because time went by so fast or because I'm not visually seeing it played out, but I'm still scratching my head as to the real issue between them, why he was so harsh/unsympathetic to Harry or why he was so hung up on bringing Cedric back. I guess I just couldn't really connect to Albus. 3. Why do the time-turners work differently here? Remember in the book how changes from the future were already being played out in the present (past) during the Dementor attack? There were no alternate realities, no butterfly effects. This is supposed to be cannon? 4. Time-turners again. As soon as I saw the word time-turner I knew Albus would be going back in the past to try to change things, but I never thought he would try to do it so cheaply. ""Hey, let's engorgio Cedric's head so he gets humiliated and doesn't win the Triwizard cup. That will change everything."" I mean, he really couldn't think of a better plot? Speaking of poorly thought out ideas- Delphi. Why the heck wouldn't Delphi just take the time-turner from the very beginning and go to Voldemort? Why even bother with ""the kids"" and with Cedric?? 5. You're telling me that good, kind, and honorable Cedric would have turned out to be a Death Eater if he hadn't won the Triwizard cup? What? What?? That is so ridiculous and eye-roll worthy. 6. What happened to the other characters? Where are George and the other Weasleys? Why is Ron running the joke shop? Why is he not an Auror? Where are the other Potter and Weasley kids? It's like they don't exist. 7. So Harry Potter, the Auror, savior of the wizarding world, Head of Magical Law Enforcement is now a weenie and can't even take on an 18 year old witch. Yeah, that's right. Are your eyes rolling too? 8. The worst and most unbelievable, incongruous portion of all. Voldemort has a freaking daughter!!?? Are you kidding me?! There is NO way. The only time I can picture Voldemort being remotely interested in pleasure of the body is when he was still young with a complete soul. After that, I don't think he was even capable of wanting it, especially having no love. Plus, I don't believe he would ever risk producing an heir; and heir would be competition. A child would weaken him, ""take"" from his being, likely his power. Somebody who could usurp him- a threat. I could sooner seen him making out with Nagini. Add on top of this that, Bellatrix would have been very pregnant around the time that the trio were taken prisoners to the Malfoy Mansion, so it's just a bunch of bologna. That being said, I realize that this is supposed to be a play and as such I am missing much of the non-verbal communication, acting, and emotion that goes behind it, but it's only a partial excuse. Macbeth was a play... so was the Crucible. That should say enough. I was torn between a 2 and 3 star, but I realized that in all honesty, had this not been ""Harry Potter,"" it would never be a three star. With Jo being so meticulous, I can't understand how she approved this. Not the concept in general, just the direction and specifics. My best advice would be watch the play first.",TRUE,children

I am a Harry Potter fan, even if I recognize that it is not great literature, it is highly entertaining and solidly written. I do not have an issue that this was a play script and not a novel. I was prepared and acknowledged that many of the important pieces like the ambiance of Hogwarts and the ""wizard world"" would be missing. Where I draw exception is how entirely inconsistent this story feels. The characters don't feel or read like those we've come to love. The plot is juvenile. For those few of you who love Harry Potter (and haven't read this play yet), you may just want to stick to the original seven books and leave your memory of Harry unsullied by this unnecessary addition. SPOILER TIME: Ron's character was a ridiculous. I know many people think he was a little superfluous in the books, too, but now he's just there for comic relief. Unfunny comic relief, at that. Cedric being humiliated once and becoming a Death Eater? I cry foul on that one. As a character, Cedric was noble enough to tell Harry about the egg, humble enough to admit that Harry had helped him, and kind enough to allow Harry to win the Triwizard tournament with him. Cedric constantly tried to limit his own father's pride, yet one humiliation turns him into a Death Eater? Not buying it. While I really didn't like the idea of Voldemort's child, it was obvious from the time she was introduced who she was. I mean, she was THE ONLY influential new person in the entire play! Let's not get into the whole time turner thing. That was the best they could come up with? Such a contrived plot device. And for pity's sake people, you can't just go whipping up Polyjuice Potion from ingredients someone has in their house; it takes a month to brew!

Not a die-hard fan like some people are, but I've always loved to read, talk about and analyze the Harry Potter books. Seeing that I would never likely make it to London to watch this much-anticipated play, I decided to spend the 15 dollars and at least read the script. My impression was that this play would be really fun to watch, with dimensions brought alive by the acting, stage tech, props, etc. However, the script itself seemed very amateur. There were parts that almost made it, but overall, it felt as though I was reading a fan-fiction. The character and plot development were weak. I understand that this is a script for a play so it could lack the complexities we found in the novels. However, the characters seemed two-dimensional or out of character. The things they did or said were either too predictable or too outlandish. Basically, I found this world of magic unbelievable and shallow. The plot was not entirely predictable, but it was definitely not original. It felt like a (spoiler here?) mash-up between Harry Potter and Back to the Future 2. The theme was obvious, but could've been delivered in a more masterful, creative way than was presented in this script. All to say, this script will fall short for Harry Potter fans who love the books for the intricate plots, attention to detail, and complex character developments. Because this script lacks all of that. As I said in the title, it may be great to watch the play unfold on stage, but it certainly wasn't as exciting to read on paper.",TRUE,children

Don't buy this book. ***MILD SPOILERS BELOW*** While I would not compare this book to a bad fanfic, I am incredibly disappointed that JK Rowling said that this story should be considered canon. The characters are nothing like themselves in the series (Professor McGonagall is now a ditzy old lady with little regard for rules when it suits her) and they're very flat. I'm not sure how characters with SEVEN BOOKS of character development behind them could possibly be this lackluster. Parts of the story are absolutely ridiculous (the snack trolley lady is an immortal being that spends her free time making explosive pumpkin pasties and sharpening her hand-spikes? Please.) Overall I was very disappointed by this book. The Harry Potter books were such an integral part of my childhood, and this book just felt like an awful mockery of a wonderful story and a sad attempt to milk more money out of the franchise.",TRUE,children

At first, I thought it was a build up to them falling in love, but it wasn't. . . they both conveniently have crushes on different girls. - The dialogue for Ron Weasley was downright annoying. It's like he regressed into being a preadolescent boy rather than maturing into an adult. - Could Scorpius be any nicer? There was no complexity to his character at all. It would have been nice to have seen Professor Lupin's son in the play. I did enjoy getting to see Snape again, but it seemed contrived that characters from the past got to tell what they were feeling to the present day characters. I wish I never read this.

I think she should have rewritten it as an actual book, if at all. I felt like this writing was very low quality and the format did not let itself to a well to being a book. I feel a letdown because Jo is an amazing writer, but this projects didn't seem to have her heart in it, at least not the written version (I can't speak for the play itself). It felt like it was lacking effort. :( Maybe all the effort was just spent dressing up the bare bones and making it a play.

The plot-line is weird, and doesn't follow along with the logic and rules established in the series. Personally, I think this book reads like fan-fiction - but BAD fan-fiction, to say the least. I spent my teenage years on sites like MuggleNet, and I have definitely read some good Harry Potter fan-fiction in the past. This story just feels wrong, and is totally amateurish.

The main characters had the same names as the ones in the original series, but that was the only thing that was familiar in this book. It was as if the writer had never read the original stories....like they'd heard about the characters from someone who'd read HP Cliff Notes. And for only the first and fourth books.

I mean you have to understand in my opinion JKR has made the most perfect characters I have ever read. They move flawlessly from books one to seven never faltering in their beliefs and standards. Not just the main three, all her characters are beautifully written. But what happened here??? Who are these people and where are the originals??? No one is what they are supposed to be. Harry is moody and mean to his SON, the orphan boy whose only relatives treated him like dirt grows up to be mean to his son???? What??? Hermoine is bossy yes but she is also a bit dull and her story here is basically about how she is supposed to be with Ron which is part of it but so much less than what she is about. Ron is running a joke shop? Why? He was never a joker I don't remember him being a big prankster.. Where is this coming from. He grew so much in seven years to be a joker in the end???? Why JKR? Why?

133821666X,2.0,Disappointing sequel to the HP series.,4,"So I can't give this one-star, because I'm too big of an HP fan to do that. And also because, in a vacuum, it would be a fine, entertaining read. I'm sure as a play, it's pretty thrilling to see. But as a hardcore fan, it was a huge disappointment. I actually am surprised that JK Rowling would put her name on such a mediocre much-anticipated sequel to her series. I don't want to give away any spoilers here. So I'll do my best to review this without revealing any plot lines. For starters the HP books, in my view, were brilliant on many levels, but particularly good due to their character development, twists and super-tight plot lines. This sequel fails on all those levels. It seems that for some very important characters, Rowling throws her previous character development down the drain. It's really troubling. The plot was also oddly predictable. The play's main twist I saw coming from the first possible moment. (I don't think I saw any of her previous twists coming in the HP books.) And the plot/story itself seems wildly implausible in several areas (whereas in the HP books, if you accept the premise that magic is a thing, the plots/stories seem very tight and believable). There are also a ton of holes. With spoilers, I could name a few dozen problems I have with the play, but I won't do that here. It's just odd that Rowling seems to ignore the canon she carefully established in the HP series and subsequent writings. I just don't get it. With that said, it's entertaining enough, if you can ignore all that stuff and just treat it as a fantasy play without worrying too hard about it fitting with what we know of the HP universe. But for major fans, it's pretty disappointing, I think. As I've seen written elsewhere, it really reads like bad fanfic.

I read the entire book in two sittings; kept waiting to be drawn in...the next page....ok the next chapter. I don't know how much of this was actually written by JKR and how much was written by the two co-authors, but this reads like a mediocre fan fic. I've never been disappointed in anything with Jo Rowling's name on it, until now. There were a couple of instances where details were completely wrong, as though the author perhaps didn't read the HP books closely enough to catch them. The best I can say is that I am glad I have it so I'm not missing a piece of the HP collection. Unlike the 7 HP books, however, I won't need a second copy of this one to keep in good shape as I wear out the first with rereadings. I won't bother to reread this.

While I know a screenplay is different than a book and would have a different ""feel"", this was just awful. I used to stay up reading the new Harry Potter book until I finished it, usually four in the morning. I had to force myself to read this all the way through. This is an insult to Harry Potter. J. K.

Towards the end, one character mentions the possibility of brewing a Polyjuice Potion in under a day. Anyone who knows the books well knows that it takes a MONTH to brew Polyjuice Potion. Am I being a little too demanding? Perhaps. But J.K. Rowling wrote the original seven books, she did NOT write this. Please note: J.K. Rowling did NOT write this! She and two others came up with the story, and then one of them wrote the actual play. That's another point: This is not a book. Don't expect Rowling's descriptions and turn of phrase---all of it is mostly dialogue as it is in play format. This will make a lot of people unhappy. It does not gel well with the other books.

That character came to life on screen exactly as I imagined."" This new expansion of the Harry Potter series completely lacks the magic of the original seven books; there is neither imagery nor character development. Albums Severus's problems seem like the trivial banalities teenagers often feel during their adolescent years. The original characters seem at odds with their book descriptions -- Harry is weak-minded, Ron a ""hilarious"" jokester, and Hermione's spells were unable to keep out a few teenagers? The character I most enjoyed was that of Scorpius Malfoy, as it seems that the writers put most of their character development into his persona. Also, the idea of Hermione as the Minister of Magic was smart, but poorly executed and underdeveloped. I agree with many others that this does not read like a storyline written by J.K. Rowling. J.K.

I knew full well that this was merely a script and not a full-blown story. I'm totally fine with that..except for the fact that it's terrible. *possible spoilers* The initial excitement of holding a new HP book wore off incredibly quickly. The characters in CC have almost no semblance whatsoever to their true HP counterparts. They are flat and dull in so many ways. And what's with the relationship between Scorpius and Albus? I fully expected this to turn into a full-blown romantic relationship because they reiterate their feelings for one another over...and over...and over...But it doesn't really add anything to the plot when they do! Speaking of plot...this one is terrible! Time travel, angsty teenage drama, more time travel, random daughter of Voldemort, more time travel...There are more holes in this plot than a cheese grater! Ugh..I have read the original HP series through many times, and will continue to do so. But this book will never be reread. I will likely give it away or give it to Goodwill as soon as my wife finishes reading it..Disappointing. Two stars because I can't 'hate' anything HP, but this is cutting it incredibly close.",TRUE,children

I understood that this was a script, and I realized that it was not written by JK Rowling herself, but rather as a collaborative work That being said, without seeing this play performed, it feels like absolute rubbish. It's possible that the story just doesn't translate well on page, but I doubt it. The flow is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious— which is really awful considering it's a script and therefore is nearly entirely dialogue. The characters are horrid; I can't believe a word of what they're saying. The tone and dialects are completely different from the novels. The original novels had a richness to them, in part due to the wonderful scenery described by Rowling. I can only hope that when performed, the play gains back some of that vivid imagery that made the books so immersive. Overall this read like a poorly executed bit of fan fiction, but I'll hold off on my final judgement until I've seen it performed on stage.",TRUE,children

Rowling and just reads like a tribute story. None of her nuance or personal flavor. It's like all the parts of the wizarding world you didn't want to know...""Grown up jobs are hard and full of paperwork even if they're with the Ministry of Magic"", ""Teenagers are moody and feel misunderstood"" (like we didn't get THAT from Order of the Phoenix), ""Being a parent is hard"".

Rowling has a better executed plot and is much better at fleshing out new characters, but she is oddly weaker at giving the canon characters interesting adult stories. Rowling's conception of the Hogwarts universe is seen through kids' eyes and flipping it around so the previous heroes are now the boring adults (and yet still get half the scenes) isn't easy. The Fantastic Beasts movie, which is basically a superhero movie set in the Harry Potter universe, is a much better vector for future exportation, I think.

Even Professor McGonagle was a shadow of her once-potent self. At times, I felt like I was watching felt-board figures being moved around.

My issue with Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is that I felt like it wasn't accurate with the JK Rowling's HP universe & characters. First off, (spoiler alert!) Hermione Granger is one of the CLEVEREST witches in the entire series. I felt that it is HIGHLY unlikely that she would've hid a time turner in a book shelf??? with a riddle easy enough for a teenager to figure out??? Second, I really don't understand how Cedric Diggory, who was a Hufflepuff - loyal and kind, would end up to be a Death Eater just because he was humiliated? Honestly that makes no sense.

133821666X,1.0,This is NOT a HP Book,27,"Let me start off by mentioning two very important point about myself as a reader: 1. I hate paying for shipping and will go out of my way to avoid it 2. I am a massive Harry Potter Fan. In fact, in preparation of reading this book I reread all the Harry Potter books. Not that I wasn't going to anyway, but it was a lovely excuse. Moving on, I have decided not only to return this book, but to pay money to return it. It cannot sit on my shelf amongst the other HP books. I refuse. There are basically three reasons why this book is not a HP book and after I have returned it and finished this review I am going to promptly forget it ever existed: 1. This is not written nor does it sound like JK Rowling. This ""story"" may have been ""based on a JK Rowling story"" but it just does not seem like it. It truly seems more like a poorly developed fan fic. JK Rowling is seamless, sophisticated. She doesn't allow for many mistakes to be made. It often felt like whoever wrote this play didn't even read the HP books but merely watched the movies. Big Mistake. 2. The story is poorly developed and poorly executed. As I mentioned, there are a ton of mistakes made. I won't go into them as other reviews have beautifully listed them. So if you want a list of all the mistakes made and the impossibilities according to previous books, look at some of the other longer reviews. 3. The characters, our characters, our beautiful trio, does not sound/act/speak or do anything like they generally would. Ron is an imbecile throughout this novel, Hermione isn't terribly bright, Harry isn't himself, not at all, and the new characters we are introduced to aren't well developed. The author (whoever it is) doesn't mention key characters like Teddy. Not to mention the direction they do go in with the plot is just beyond ridiculous. The author seems to spend more time on Cedric Diggory than he does on Ron or Hermione. While reading this book I continued to keep in mind that this book is written as a play, that reading a play is different from reading a novel, and that as a play you will not get the same emotional insight as you would in a novel. Apparently it is very good watching this play on stage. However, as a book, I cannot and do not like this and for me, it is not ""the next installment"" but a poorly written and poorly developed fan fic turned into a play. I am so disappointed. I can't even believe JK Rowling approved this for publication.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,I liked the movies,8,"I liked the movies. I loved the books. This? I'm pissed about. 15 bucks for the kindle version down the drain. I was able to get into it despite it being still just the literal script. But that stripped the entire world from it. The actual books had the nuance of the day to day life of a schoolkid. The snowball fights. The taste of butterbeer. I'm sure this gets more as an actual play, because the play lets the actors bring the characters to life. But when reading it, I need the ""stage"" to be the extra words describing the scene. This felt like an 'artistic' minimalist play of one actor up there just delivering the lines and expecting us to appreciate that. I didn't. Maybe that's on me, who knows. The characters also didn't feel like themselves. There's some lines from Harry I just can't picture him saying, despite him being 40 now. And there's some 'youthful adventurous' scenes, one specifically on the Hogwarts train, that just seems absolutely silly. I also agree that it feels more like a fanfic. The returning characters seem more written with the surface personalities, not with the nuanced other personality traits you sensed under the surface with a whole book. The bare bones maybe gives me hope. Maybe if a legitimate book is written around this it wouldn't be bad. And maybe with the actors bringing the lines to life, the play may be great. But this?

It just doesn't fit with the 7 other books. Ginny lost her fire, Harry is an a**, Hermione is just not that stupid.

This, however, is a chaotic mess, a mash-up of other story arcs, and a monumental disappointment. While the script format could have been clever, the plot is lame and the dialogue is forced and silly. The characters we had come to know through the ""real"" Harry Potter books are watered-down, shallow, thin, and barely recognizable. I kept reading waiting for redeeming value, but sadly, there is none to be found in this horribly written bit of overly sentimental schlock.

That is the only way I can justify the grossly out-of-character depictions of no less than Ron, Voldemort, Snape, and Harry himself.

I walked into this realizing that the book was not written by JK Rowling and as such would be different in tone, but this was honestly not good. I, like everyone else here, have read all the Harry Potter books and am an avid fan, so when I saw an 8th book was coming out to expand on the short epilogue, I was obviously excited. One page in I already knew that this was not going to be what I expected. The dialogue between the characters was awkward and stunted, the jokes were painful, and the way the writer worded some actions just didn't make sense. For example, can we talk about this line? ""The Sorting Hat walks through the students, who spring into their houses"". Since when does the Sorting Hat walk around? I haven't even mentioned how odd Ron is in this book. He cracks Dad jokes and pranks people, which would be fine if he was George or even Mr. Weasley, but Ron had never struck me as the dad jokes and running a joke shop guy. Everything just feels wrong. There was even a line in there about Professor McGonagall walking around with a large smile on her face. Since when is Professor McGonagall a cheery, wide-smile kind of lady?

The way the kids talked, which has been a strong suit of hers, was stiff and just sad by comparison. Sorry. I just really hated this.

Sure it was an OK book, but ""OK"" doesn't cut it in the Potter fandom. There is no Harry Potter without J.K Rowling, and it showed. To be realistic, I would never recommend this book as a HP Sequel because the only thing it will ever have in common is the fact there's a Potter on the title.

I am a massive Harry Potter fan and I absolutely love the books and movies. 3. I'm sure this is a very entertaining play to watch, but it does not belong in the Harry Potter franchise/universe. Okay. The biggest problem with Cursed Child is that it wasn't written by Rowling. She can pretend that she had something to do with it, but she didn't, or if she did, she must really no longer care at all what happens to her precious wizarding world. This story had so many major plot holes that would never fly in a HP novel. Part of what makes Harry Potter so special is the amount of details that JK put into it. Nothing in the HP books was an accident, and even today almost 10 years later fans continue to notice amazing details that no other author would take the time to put into a ""children's"" story. Cursed Child reads like fan fiction, and there is nothing wrong with fanfiction, but it pisses me off to no end that Rowling is calling this an official sequel to her otherwise perfect series. This writer was lazy and decided to recycle a cliche story-line while ruining our beloved characters in the process. What is the point?We did not need this story. It gives no new insight to the wizarding world (unlike any of the short stories that were actually written by Rowling, those are great) and it does not tell us anything that we didn't already know about Harry. Spoiler alert (but not really): Harry works at the Ministry of Magic! His relationship with his son isn't perfect! But after useless conflict that only rehashes the past, everyone lives happily ever after! The magic of Rowling's books is not present here, and there are at least 3 major plot holes that ruin the entire integrity of the story. I don't want to actually spoil anything, because I do believe that you should read it for yourself, but this book is a disgrace. What makes me the most angry is that this piece of sh*t was given to us, and then Rowling says ""that's it for Harry! Cursed Child is the end of his story!"" when it should have never been part of his story in the first place.

This seems to be just written for high action entertainment instead of plot likers. Besides the plot holes it seems to contradict things from the book series. It was an easy read that I finished in 24 hours. There were very clear differences between the books that were writtten by JK and this joint effort. This book lacks her wit and humor and just repeats things from her books. I've read and loved the 7 Harry Books she wrote MANY times. So it was very tedious to reread quotes from them over and over and over again. This play is like one of those tv shows where they just show you the clips from old episodes with very little new material. And I'm guessing this play makes the assumption that you've read her updates to the story on Pottermore? There were some real holes in continuity from where the last book left off and where this one picked up. We miss out on a lot of the beloved characters. There is no Dursely humor. There is no Hagrid, no house elves, only the mention of a ghost other than Moaning Myrtle who gets a few lines, ------ spoiler alert-------------- In book 7, Voldemort killed the horcrux residing in Harry. That got rid of Harry's scar and his ability to speak Parsiltongue. Both his scar and Parsiltongue are back in this book. His scar hurt in the books because he had Voldemort's soul fragment, Horcrux, in his body. That's gone now yet his scar hurts because of Voldemort's daughter being around? Since he no longer is connected to Voldemort, he has no connection to his daughter. I'll never pre-order a book from Amazon again.

They can only recite what's on their scripts, So if you ask them a question that's not on their script they just keep reciting things that don't have anything to do with what you are asking about, such as what time in my own time zone will this be downloaded to my kindle? Can I do anything to download it as soon as it's midnight? - no answer to either question, then after all they put me through, to cancel my order? And that's on top of them poorly pronouncing English words so that they are barely recognizable. They talk in a loud background so you can barely make out what they are saying.

The only thing I can guarantee is that JK Rowling had nothing to do with the crafting of this story. Reading a play is an inherently different experience from reading a novel, of course. Novels like the Potter series are full of rich narration and world building, whereas a play is reliant almost solely on the quality of the dialogue. Nuances in character development and narrative must come to life in the dialogue, even when watching a stage production, because true theater doesn't rely on sets, scenery or special effects. Reading the play should be comprable to seeing it live: of course, quality actors bring it to life, but seeing King Lear in person isn't generally any more powerful than reading the incredible script in your living room. Was I naive for hoping for this kind of quality? Probably not, considering the playwrights are so accomplished. The dialogue in Rowling's books was, admittedly, not the most compelling, but her narrative and world building made up for it. Absent that, and absent a writer with a gift of crafting character interactions, this book was a massive disaster. It truly does read like bad fanfiction, with massive leaps of logic and plot holes that are impossible to swallow and one-dimensional, cookie-cutter characters (something I think the Potter books avoided foxily). As a lifelong Potter fan, I can't really accept this as canon, and I hope that those new to the Potter universe will avoid this chapter in the saga entirely.",TRUE,children

The way this book trampled over the original series was in a way horrifying. Taking something I truly love and manipulating it to create a dumb story about even dumber kids. It becomes very hard to believe that Harry would have a child so dumb. Many people told me to read this as if it was a fan fiction to help improve my opinion of it, but it didn't work.

As I said - this is nothing more than fan fiction, and poorly written at that. This reads more like the literary attempts of a 14 year old fan girl. A best seller?

Not only do I want a refund for my money, I also want a refund for the time I spent waiting for this. The dialogue was terrible, and the characters of the Harry Potter we know and love did not exist in this play. Everything Harry, Ron and Hermione said or did was completely out of character. I won't give examples so as not to spoil it for anyone who might have actually liked this. Except one-pigeons???? What in the world? I'm sorry but no. Harry is not afraid of pigeons. The plot was unoriginal. I've read dozens of unprofessional Harry Potter fan fictions with the the same exact one. There were too many continuity errors to count. I spent good money on this, and I'm restraining myself from throwing it in the trash. Harry Potter fans deserved a better story than this.

The relationship development was clumsy. In trying to show a close relationship between friends, the author made it seem like Albus and Scorpious would end up together but then it came to nothing. The author clearly had no experience writing relationships or young characters. Also, Harry is a complete jerk throughout (probably because he can't come to terms with his son being gay). His charter as a whole is completely tarnished. Finally, there are a lot of characters I'd rather see in this than voldermort's secret love child. None of the other Weasly kids appear, no Teddy, no Victorie. And Ron has reverted back to the maturity of a 14 year old. Poor Hermione!

I didn't have very high expectations going in, and I already knew the facts: it was a play that wasn't actually written by J.K. Rowling and it was most certainly not going to be Harry Potter #8. That being said, I was quite frustrated when I finished reading. It took me less than 2 hours to read through this, and with each new twist I became increasingly confused as to how JKR could've approved this story. The characters have the same names as the ones in the HP series, and some of the magic is the same, but the play is completely inconsistent with canon. The characters seem like different people in many cases, and usually the version in the play is worse. For example, Ron is a worse version of movie-Ron. Things that were carefully detailed in the books are thrown away for gimmicks. Many aspects of the story come off as badly-executed fan service. Maybe seeing the play would make this more tolerable, but the story itself isn't what you'd expect for the HP universe. If you feel like you should read the story out of completeness as an HP fan (which is why I bought the book), I'd recommend trying to borrow it from the library (or at least not paying full price for the hardcover edition).",TRUE,children

And as far as the series goes, it's completely out of touch, and ruins pretty much every character involved. Ron is reduced to pure comic relief and has no substance whatsoever. Malfoy is.....nice and understanding?? And the plot is just so awful. I'm not giving away any spoilers here, but it makes no sense on so many levels.

I like the narrative, not just the story-telling (none of that here), but the brushstrokes of character development applied by the narrator’s word choice, the incorporation of setting into the plot. Oh yes, and here there’s virtually no plot. Rather than the unexpected twists and twists Rowling gave us in the real books, this has a circumstance – plot is too strong a word. The circumstance emerges with the props (no spoilers here) and is instantly apparent to anyone who has ever read, well, a book. Besides being obvious, the circumstance is stupid. It’s a failed Saturday Night Live skit. I could go on and on. I won’t.

This story, however, is equivalent to poorly written fanciful fan fiction with little direction. I was a theatre major in college and have read literally hundreds of play scripts, so that was not the issue for me. It simply did not seem like Rowling wrote this. The plot and exposition were uncomplicated, slow, and simply bad. The characters seemed very different from their former selves (even taking into account that, yes, of course 37 year old Harry, Ron, and Hermione will be different and more mature than their 17 year old selves). And the language was not the same magic we know and love from the books. Again, I know all too well that novels and plays are different artistic mediums, yet still, this story falls very flat.

The harry I know would have been proud his son was bridging the gap between malfoys and potters. Even if he was a little upset he would have encouraged his son to continue with his friendship.

It's as if they not only haven't grown or developed since we last saw them, but have regressed. It isn't due to being presented in ""play"" form; I can read a play and envision the emotions and descriptions that are left out. It's due to the terrible character ""development"" (of which there is very little) and the way in which beloved characters (Ron, Hermione, Harry, Draco, Snape, Dumbledore, etc.), who were developed lovingly and extensively over 7 previous books, suddenly act like whiny babies, or broadly comedic fools, or over-sensitive children instead of adults. Professor McGonagall, one of my favorite characters in the ""real"" books, loses her sternness, her sense of fairness, her common sense, and comes off as vacillating and foolish. Dumbledore seems to be suffering from old age dementia, with his bumbling ""advice"" and teariness. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and fully expected to love and cherish this book. Instead I HATED it.

My favorite characters appeared in name only, with none of the depth, charm or interesting dynamics that made the original Potter books so compelling. Perhaps the lack of character development could have been saved by an interesting plot, but the Cursed Child lacks that as well. The storyline is driven by how growing up in the shadow of his father, Harry Potter, makes Albus Potter a dark and tortured soul. Although Albus' siblings seem perfectly well adjusted (basically mini-Fred and mini-Ginny), Albus suffers from ANGST, causing him to pull incredibly stupid stunts that advance the plot in the absence of any logic or reason. Clever, creative world building could have possibly saved this illogical story with flat, annoying characters. And yet the writers fail to add any dimensions to the HP Universe, instead using old set pieces (that I used to know and love) in ways that make no sense while simultaneously sucking all the whimsy and wonder out of Magical Britain.

I agree with others in that this does not read like Harry Potter at all, even Harry himself sounds very odd. I kept thinking to myself while reading the dialogue ""Well that doesn't sound like Harry, or Hermione!"" which lost all credibility with me. I, like others, am writing this one off and ending the story in my head at Deathly Hollows. I think all fans out there wish JK Rowling would put the time and effort into furthering the world of HP and the series, I would have loved it if she just took 1/4 of this plot line and developed it more so we could immerse ourselves into this Voldemort free, new world and it's new generation characters..",TRUE,children

He isn't the witty, kindhearted man/boy we saw in the series. This book just had him as comic relief, and honestly, I didn't like that. Hermione, she was foolish enough to hide the Time Turner in a BOOK of all places! Hermione isn't that foolish. Even then, when Albus and Scorpius went back in time, she wasn't patient, she pressured her students. Now Albus and Scorpius. Scorpius is a nice boy, but he was also foolish. He let Albus lead him back in time, resulting in losing Rose, and Albus being no longer alive. I honestly wonder why Scorpius is even in Slytherin. Albus as well. Albus is very Very VERY stupid. He broke into the Ministry, stole the Time Turner, resulting in going back in time and losing Rose, Voldemort being alive and such. He even made Cedric be an Death eater. Speaking of that. Why would embarrassing Cedric in the Triwizard tournament turn him into a Death Eater? Honestly, that doesn't make sense. Now for Delphi , Voldemort, and Bellatrix. It says that they have a child but isn't Voldemort incapable of loving? Even so, it says that this happened when Hermione Pollyjuiced into Malfoy Manor. How did they not notice Bellatrix being pregnant when sneaking in? This is mad. Now Dumbledore. He barely was in here, but he wasn't any help emotionally.

Firstly: time travel is a weak plot line at best. After waiting years for a new story from Jo we get ""what would have happened if Cedric hadn't died"" this was such a let down. Secondly: Cedric being embarrassed during the triwizard tournament would have been enough to cause someone who we remembered as brave, and selfless, to become a death eater? What type of garbage is that? How dare they drag his name through the mud and tarnish his memory like this. Thirdly: Voldemort has a child? This is such a plot line cop out and even while reading it this doesn't make sense. Voldemort was conceived under a love potion, he doesn't know or understand love. Even with Bellatrix falling head over heels for him, in what universe do these two get together and make a baby? And wouldn't Hermione have noticed that Bellatrix was pregnant when she used polyjuice potion to become her so they could enter her vault in Deathly Hallows? And then Scorpious and Albus constantly referring to eachother as their best friend got to be annoying. And I am still wondering what qualities either of these boys possess that had them sorted into slytherin. There were parts I did enjoy but they were few and far between. This is without a doubt garbage and I hope that Jo did not write this and that a corrected version of this will appear on pottermore or in print at a later date.

I advise everyone who is considering the book not to read it, and I truly wish I hadn't.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Heartbroken,1,"I couldn't even bring myself to finish this. And yeah yeah, I'm horrible for reviewing it without finishing it first. But as a loyal and long time Harry Potter fan, this work really did upset me. The fact that it was written in a play format was one thing. Just watch 'A Very Potter Musical' if that's what you want. But on top of that, the characters were two dimensional, the plot was forced, and the world seemed to have a lot less magic in it this time around. I could go on about all the little things that bothered me (WHY would Hermione Granger leave a riddle for people to follow in order to find the super top secret, dangerous time turner??? She's way too smart for that!!!) but I won't. Basically, if you're a long time Harry Potter fan, don't turn to this book expecting to have your hunger satisfied. The most you'll get from it is an allergic reaction and some indigestion.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,I Felt Punked.,41,"I was shocked when I opened Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. It wasn't a book with lovely prose at all; it was a script--for a movie! I was annoyed. My first reaction was to retrieve the shipping box from the trash, repack it and send it back. I sent my spouse to do just that while I checked the book out again on Amazon and saw the description I had missed when I placed the order. My bad. I checked to see if there was a novel of this eighth book. There was not. The 'rehearal' script for the upcoming movie was all there was. I opened the book to see if I could tolerate the read. I could. Though I felt punked, I decided to keep the book, skip the movie and write this review. I'll give it one star; it is in book form.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Ug!,64,"I made the mistake of rereading the original series immediately before reading this. Mistake number one. I purchased this book/script after being on the fence about it for months. Mistake number two. I read the many disappointed reviews and still spent money on it. Mistake number three. That said. I'm sure the play itself really helps in covering up the rickety story line and many gaping plot holes. I'd imagine the play is perfectly enjoyable to watch. This, however was so disappointing to read. And that's coming from a huge Harry Potter AND time travel fantasy fan. Our beloved characters acted so far out of character throughout. The story jumps several years in a single bound. Everything is incredibly forced (relationships, personality traits, conversations) and doesn't sound like Rowling at all! If you must buy this, I recommend reading only after its been a good year since you read the original 7 books. That way you have a decent opportunity to forget as much as possible about the original story and don't compare the new story too closely with the originals. I hated the last chapter of the 7th book for how forced and out of character it was, and this book was exactly the same. And, if you're looking for a great fanfic, check out the James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Just Don't,43,"This book was very disappointing. I am not even sure exactly what I was expecting, but this was not it. The characters were not very well developed and there was very little explanation of what was going on outside of the characters conversations. I understand that it's meant to be watched, so you would then see those details but if they are going to release it as a book then it should be a complete story. This felt like I was catching bits and pieces of a story. I don't recommend this at all, very sad waist of $14.99 and makes me fairly unhappy with the whole series.. which is a bummer.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,The worst HP fanfiction ever...,191,"Read this as a library copy before deciding to buy it. It's that bad. The play format isn't obnoxious; it's easy to read. That's the only thing going for this book; you'll get through it quickly, provided you don't damage it too badly throwing it across the room in disgust every time you encounter another badly-written passage. Everything other reviewers are saying about this being a fanfiction is true. The characters are underdeveloped; after everything we saw in the first books, there was a lot they could have drawn on for who these characters are. They also don't seem to be very British anymore, which is odd. The interaction between characters is wooden and in places just ridiculous. The plot... I won't give spoilers, but let's just say that there's so much deus ex machina that it's downright disturbing. Rather than inventing a new plot, they contrived a way to retread the old plots, which feels cheap and lazy. The teenagers don't act like teenagers. Too many of the conversations are exposition tools, and in stilted language that kids don't use. It's as if they didn't actually know any teenagers when they wrote this. The adults, however, DO sound like teenagers. They simultaneously kept the teenage mannerisms of the main HP characters, without keeping their inherent deeper personalities. I don't believe in bad books. But... this is a bad book. Even on its own, it would be a brutal read; as part of the HP universe, it's a bitter disappointment.",TRUE,children

Spoiler alert ....with Harry having Sirius as a God father he knew what he missed out on. the fact that his son felt unloved is beyond reason. I mean growing up with the Dursleys and seeing Ron's family. Harry saw what it took to be a family. My personal opinion is this play shouldn't have been written. J. K. Rowling had such a living breathing memoir with the seven books and movie. My disappointment knows no bounds.,TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,JK Rowling was apart of this? Really? I have a tough time believing this is her work. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!,29,"First off, I am a huge Harry Potter fan when it comes to the original 7 books and 8 movies. I was one of those kids who had to get the book on day 1 of release, just so I could read until 2am before having my mother yell at me to shut the lights off and go to bed. In which case I'd grab a flashlight just to continue reading. I knew there would be spoilers from others around me if I didn't hurry up and read as much as possible each day. I should also add that prior to Harry Potter I hated reading books with a passion. Finally, I found a series that held my interest from start to finish. Fast forward to now, as an adult. Yet another Harry Potter book is on the shelves. This time it is a play. That wasn't a problem for me. I've read plays in the past. Here's a breakdown of what I didn't like: -It comes off as a poorly written fanfic. It's obvious JK Rowling had very little say in this. Why her name is even on the book is beyond me. This is not her work. Supposedly they agreed on the story together, but I just have a tough time believing this. It's as if she was too nice to tell Jack Thorne (the real writer) no. She should have disagreed with it for numerous reasons, which I will go into detail below. -The characters are not themselves, for one. Yes, I understand that 19 years has gone by, but even so that's no excuse for how drastically different some of them were. -It's all about time travel. We were told all the time turners were destroyed, but now all of the sudden we learn that one time turner still exists that allows you to go back in time for 5 minutes. Harry's son, Albus, and Malfoy's son, Scorpius, are friends who decide to go back in time and save Cedric. Yup, that's the plot. Time travel is the plot. -Voldemort has a daughter. Bellatrix is the mother. She was pregnant and gave birth in book 7 .... Need I say more? I don't think I have to explain how insane that one is. Anyway, their daughter uses Scorpius and Albus to change the past and basically bring Voldemort back. -We learn that Cedric's death was a good thing because he'd have become a death eater otherwise. Apparently he was so hurt by losing the Triwizard tournament (after time travel affected everything) and embarrassed that he became a death eater as a result. Again, what!? -Where's George? We learn Ron is running the joke shop. Cool, but where the heck is George? -Where are Albus's siblings whenever things go crazy and his life is in danger? It's just Harry and Ginny who freak out. Where's the rest of the family? I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. I love JK Rowling and will forever love the original Harry Potter series, but again this is not her work. She had very little, if any, say in this. This is Jack Thorne's work and I am not a fan. Sorry to put it so bluntly.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,"Yuk! If your looking for great storytelling, look somewhere else.",29,"Was very skeptical about the fact this was a play & my 1st instincts were correct. I was so excited to see a new Harry Potter story, even though I'm 62 y/o, that I ordered impulsively w/o waiting for reader reviews. JK Rowling may have given her blessing & gotten a monetary chunk of the sales, but that women's ability to tell a great story is NOWHERE to be found in this new release!! This is going straight to ebay.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Terrible. Disappointing. Not true to the main series.,2,"Reads like low rent fan fiction written by someone who didn't read the 7 main books or didn't understand them. I have no issue with this being a script book and not a novel, the issue isn't that it's a script, the issue is that the characters we know so well don't sound like themselves. It dares to inexpertly violate the original story. The very basic premise just doesn't resonate with what we know about Voldemort. JKR should have never endorsed this. I'll try my best to forget this exists.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,You're Better Off Reading Actual Fanfiction,5,"I'll start with the good things about the book since there's barely anything good about it. The good things about the book are that some of the concepts are a little interesting and that Scorpius Malfoy is actually endearing in several parts. That's pretty much it. The bad things are that a lot of the concepts are convoluted or just make no sense in the grand scheme. The plot itself is a hot mess. A lot of the characters are badly written and even just parts of the story are badly written. I don't know why, but I'm still really stuck on the fact that 'darker, blacker robes' that Scorpius ended up in during one of the timelines. I strongly recommend you avoid this book and just hit up some actual fanfiction sites. I promise you that there's better written fanfiction out there and it won't cost you any money to read them.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Words cannot describe my disappointment,15,"I am a very big fan of Harry Potter. I have read and re-read the entire series more times than I can count. I own 8 different sets of the books in a variety of formats so I always have access to them. I had been eagerly looking forward to reading this latest installment in the series and had pre-ordered my copy months ago. That said, words cannot describe how incredibly disappointed I was with this book. I knew it was not a novel. I had accepted that. In fact, that was the least of the problems in the reading. I knew that it was not written entirely by J.K. Rowling. I had, however, assumed (incorrectly, it seems) that since she had given her approval and blessing to the story that it was worthy of her name. I was sadly mistaken. SPOILER ALERT Having hoped for a reunion with all the old characters and perhaps an introduction to some new ones, I was very disappointed to see our old friends so flat and out of character. Yes, people change over time, but these were almost resembling the ""Horcrux Harry and Horcrux Hermione"" of the final book in the sense that they were similar to our characters yet horribly different. In this case, they were flat. They acted and spoke in ways the original characters would never have done. Even the photo of Dumbledore was a caricature of his former self. I read the entire book, however, as I did, I found myself anxious to finish and dispose of it. Canon or no, this will not be joining my beloved sets of books. I have seen fan fiction that is better than this. Indeed, it is written like a poorly executed piece of fanfic. There were so many different ways the characters of Albus and Scorpius could have been developed. And why, after having lived in a magical world for so many years where people routinely lived to be hundreds of years old, are the characters dying so young? We are led to believe that Malfoys are gone, that the parents of many of their former classmates are gone, that professors are gone. I do not understand why this has happened, and there is little in the way of explanation. Overall, I was very disappointed in the writing quality. Perhaps the stage version is richer and more detailed than what we see here, and I truly hope it is, but if given my choice at this moment, I certainly would not pay to see this performed.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Wish I hadn't read this,1,"Of all the fanfic in the world, why this one? It just kept getting worse. The plot holes, character issues, not to mention the offensive presumptions that someone must be just like their parents (ie the Voldemort thing and some of that dialogue). At least this saved me a couple hundred dollars by not buying tickets for the Broadway show. It's truly awful and I began reading on vacation not knowing anything about it and looking forward to a good story.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Obliviate,13,"The only way to justify this amateurish script, which has much beloved characters wildly out of character, is as a semi-autobiographical play written by Scorpius or Albus within the HP universe. It is not compliant with book canon plus author interviews. It is not compliant with the characters as presented in the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. Characters that should be there (Neville, the Weasleys, most importantly) are completely missing and not even mentioned. I wish I could obliviate.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Wish I did not read,9,"I found the dialogue, ""simple"" and the relationships archaic. J.K. Rowling achieved with books 1-7 what only a handful of authors have. She made non-readers and readers, both young and old ,male and female discover a passion for reading and to actually anticipate a book to be released. For me Harry was never Daniel Radcliffe or whoever is playing him on stage but he was her words and my imagination first and formost. As with most people who read the books first. By releasing it in this form and without staying true to the characters, and parts that even counteract the previous books it took ,for me ,the escape and true ""magic"" away.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Awful,206,"Most of this book is just reverberating the plot of former books through dreams etc. it's awful. At one point it says 1994, then says 25 years ago and the back says 19 years ago. At this point they are just trying to make money and don't care about the fans or character authenticity or accuracy. They were all weak characters, and not the young, charming, inexperienced weak, that you'd expect from past writings. They all came across as middle aged disgruntled Muggles, lol. Too real for me - no charm. I don't think Rowling even read it. If she did, she should be ashamed.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Ugh.,3,"Having come to Harry Potter and his world later than most, I can honestly say that the whole series is really fresh in my mind. This play was a bitter disappointment. I knew it was a play, and I have no problem with that format. But there was little to nothing enjoyable about this reading experience. I honestly wish I had never read it. The characters are poorly written. The characters we know and love- Harry, Hermoine, Ron- are poor imposters of themselves. Ron is portrayed more or less like a bumbling idiot. Hermoine is conceited and shallow. Harry is a mere shadow of the man he should be. I don’t care if Harry Potter didn’t know his dad- I can’t imagine him so self-absorbed that he can’t figure out how to parent, and that is how he is portrayed in this book. And it’s not just the characters we loved... it’s the characters we loved to hate. Spoiler alert: Draco Malfoy confesses he never saw himself as a powerful ministry person... he just wanted to be a professional quidditch player and be happy. Barf!! Snape, when confronted with those who know he was really good all along, takes up the torch and plays the hero. Yeah.... no. The whole idea that Voldemort had a child... and by Bellatrix Lestrange?!?... is laughable. We’re supposed to believe that while he was plotting to get rid of Harry Potter once and for all, Voldemort took time out to impregnate Bellatrix, and she had the baby in the Malfoy mansion before the battle of Hogwarts? It’s honestly insulting to anyone who actually read the real books. I honestly cannot think of anything I liked about this story. The characters were poorly fleshed out, the dialogue was cheesy, the story was weak. I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I sincerely wish I had never read this book- let alone purchased it.

Nothing even makes sense. It is just so so so bad. Like many other people said, it reads like bad fan fiction. I've actually read BETTER fan fiction than this book. I am so disappointed.

133821666X,1.0,A Disappointment,2,"I was so excited to get the book! Unfortunately my expectations did not meat reality. Upon closer inspection JK Rowing is listed as just one of the 3 authors. With reading the book this fact is apparent. All previous books are grabbing and one could hardly put them down. With this one there is no new story, just repetitions of ideas of previous books. I wonder if JK Roling wrote any of it. I could read the book only half way and this comes from an avid Harry Potter fan.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,The Greatest Disappointment.,8,"This is the Phantom Menace equivalent to the Harry Potter series. An absolute disgrace to the Potter name. I can't even begin to tell you how uncomfortable most of the dialogue makes me. What's worse is the series of events that Albus Potter and his friend Scorpius Malfoy get themselves into...I wanted to strangle them. And that's too bad, because seeing them become friends and grow together was occasionally touching...but wow, they do some stupid s***! Stupid beyond any rationality, just unforgivably stupid things that are up there with the Three Stooges. The best scenes are probably between Harry and Albus, but even those leave me feeling mixed. I feel like the strongest point of this story is the development of Harry as a father. It's understandable that a guy who was raised most of his life without parents would hit a few bumps in the road when being a parent himself. I also think the dialogue of Hermione, Draco, Ginny, and a few brief scenes with Dumbledore's portrait are good. Unfortunately, the story is more focused on revisiting the past, which deducts time for us to get acquainted with new characters or new magical phenomena (like we normally get in other Potter installments). It's got too much fan-service for my taste, which bums me out.The whole damn thing reads like fan-fiction. I can only imagine at this time how beautiful a live performance must be, but it will never be forgiven for the LOADS of retconning and TACKY plot devices that make a joke out of this once reputable franchise Despite a few good scenes here and there, it's a total farce. It plays out more like a bad TV miniseries on the Disney channel. If counted in the series, it's undoubtedly the worst. But for the sanctity of my Harry Potter experience, I'd rather consider this a ""what if?"" story. And as long as there's no movie or official novelization of the script, I think that's a fair assessment. This script wasn't even written by JK.",TRUE,children

Screenplay! UGH. Soooo irritating. I ordered it without clicking on the detail assuming it was a readable book, and then made the mistake of saving it for vacation which took me beyond the return period before I realized that this was not what I thought I had ordered. Upon reviewing further, if you just look at the photo and order you would never know. Very misleading.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,"Disappointing, pandering, and disingenuous",4,"I was greatly disappointed. I was so excited by the concept of getting a glimpse of the old characters that I loved so much growing up and getting to really meet their children and see their lives. But I was left with more questions than I entered with. I understand that this wasn't actually a book, it was a script for a play and that Rowling couldn't include all the details as she could've in a novel. So for that matter, why couldn't she just write a book? Why did it have to be a play? After the seventh book, Rowling insisted, again and again that she was done with the original characters and wouldn't be revisiting them. But then she did and did so in a way that seemed to be a slap in the face to her fans. She doesn't seem invested in the story anymore just seems to be experimenting with what the most money she could make with the least amount of work. It feels like she slapped this together in a week or less and also seems completely detached with what is possible with live performances. If felt like she thought she was writing a movie, but then settled for a play. Where was Teddy Tonks? He wasn't even mentioned but it is implied that since Harry was his guardian, he (and maybe Ginny) raised him since he was orphaned. I was so excited to see the dynamic of Harry (an orphan with abusive awful guardians) raises another orphan. But Teddy wasn't even mentioned for a second. That is insulting to Lupin and Tonks who acted as family to Harry. Why would Rowling bother writing that detail into the books if she wasn't going to bother sticking to it and keeping him in the picture of the potter family. A common theme through all the books is Harry desperation for familly. He was so fixated on his desperation for biological family that he neglects his true family. Ron, Hermione, the members of DA and others. So, when Harry does have children, why on earth would he neglect one of them? It doesn't seem right and all the characters in ""The Cursed Child"" seem like a shell of themselves. I could write pages and pages on my disappointment with this ""book"" and with the franchise in general at the moment, but no one would read that and I just don't have the time. Also, this book is $16, which is $15 overpriced than what I believe it is worth. A real miss by JK Rowling.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,An awful conclusion to my favorite childhood book series,2,"This novel ruined a lot of the Harry Potter canon I grew up to know and love. The characters have become completely foreign to me - I do not recognize them. I despised Harry's son Albus, he seemed to be a largely annoying, whiny brat, who has far less sense than Harry did on his worst day. Ron has become nothing more than a bumbling comic relief stooge. On the whole, the book felt incredibly cheesy, made me cringe, and I had to struggle to finish it. In my mind, despite what J.K. Rowling says, the Harry Potter series ended with the seventh book. Can anyone hit me with an 'Obliviate' memory spell because I'd love to forget about ever reading this.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,I wanted to like it. I really really did,"1,282","I want to start this by saying that I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I grew up with Harry, I went to midnight premiers of the books and movies. I was so excited for this play. I wanted to like it. I really really did. If you are a fan I would say read it and form your own opinion. Here is what I thought: - Where was George? - Where was Teddy? Because he was in the station in th epilogue. - Where was Hugo? You know the other child Ron and Hermione have. - Lily and James Potter… MIA for most of the play. Like James? Was he even in it? - Why was Ron running the joke shop? He is an Auror. WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE? WHY WASN’T HE RUNNING THE SHOP?! - Let’s talk about Ron. Why was he so non-Ron like? His character, all jokes no supporting and listening to Harry and Hermione. Also he is hardly in the play. - Harry’s relationship with Albus. Everything about this is upsetting. o In the last book when they are dropping off the children at the Hogwarts express, the kids are genuinely confused as to why everyone is looking at them and Ron makes a joke saying “I’m famous”. It is deduced that the kids do not know the extent of everything their parents went through to save the world. Yet Albus feel the weight of his dad’s legacy. Huh. o Then we have Harry SEPARATING Albus and Scorpious. Let’s go back to that epilogue where they all see Draco with his family and a joke gets made about not playing with his son. Which then Hermione corrects and Ron says to beat him on test but not to get too cozy and marry him. Again, making it seem that everything in the past is in the past. Then there is Harry’s history of friends at Hogwarts. He knows. He would not separate his son from his ONLY friend. - Albus choosing Slytherin for a friend? Awesome. - The rumors of Voldemort having a child and that not being stopped by the ministry? Stupid. The ministry would have stopped panic about an heir being possible. Also Voldemort was conceived without love. He never cared about having an heir because he wanted to be in power. An heir would have been competition for him. - More on that point. Bellatrix pregnant. She would have loved to mother the Dark Lords child; there would have been no greater honor. But. This does not work with the original time line. Bella is never pregnant, she fights at the battle. And then the gang goes to Malfoy manor there is no baby in sight. And if. IF. Voldemort would have wanted an heir; wouldn’t he have made it a horcrux and offered it more protection? - Sexual tension between Scorpious and Albus. Yet Albus has a crush on Delphi and Scorpious on Lily. I feel as though either they should have been opened about their romantic feels towards each other or this should have not been included. - The flashbacks/dreams Harry has. When Dudley is mentioned (yay!) and you find out petunia is dead. I know she was horrible but I do think Harry would have deep feelings about his mother’s sister passing. I liked the blanket part. - Bellatrix husband somehow got out of Azkaban and raised Delphi. How did he escape Azkaban? Because there is no way he got pardoned. So how did he escape? And after escaping how was there no alarm over him escaping. Sirius Black escapes and the freaking muggle minister is alerted! Then there is a massive breakout and it is all over the daily prophet. But hey, this guy who tortured the Longbottoms into insanity he escapes and it’s cool. Yeah, sounds legit. - The new prophecy. First of all: how did it happen with no one knowing about it except Delphi. Who made it? It’s sounding more and more as if this witch convinced herself that she is the heir of the dark lord. - Cedric. Cedric a character who was noble and good and died oh so tragically. This character who was loyal and kind and helped Harry turns DARK SIDE?!?! BECAUSE HE LOSES THE CUP. WHAT?!?! CEDRIC A DEAD EATER HAHAHAHA NOPE NOT FUNNY. Thank you for turning a good character and completely changing him for the worse. Thank goodness you did not include Sirius Black in your play. - On that same characters changing note. The trolley lady…. Hm. I will just leave it at that. - Polyjuice potion. That s*** takes a month to make. I read the chamber of secrets. Many times. It takes an effing month. And you need a piece of the person you are changing into. But wait not, here I got some polyjuice potion here in my back pocket and I just happen to carry my dad and his best friends hairs at all times. So let’s change into them and break into the ministry. - Btw that potion is not necessary because you can transfigure a HUMAN. Seven books and that never came out. Must be very dark magic. - On the dark magic note. Harry duels Delphi (a eighteen year old) and she is stronger? Um. Do we not recall Harry being a teenager and he beat Voldemort. His wand is the s***. So yeah how does this even make sense? - The no sugar diet. WHAT. Sounds like something movie Ginny would do, not book Ginny.",TRUE,children

I can see where Special Effects on stage in London could make this more appealing...this story NEEDS it!

I was part of the Harry Potter generation to the fullest, reading and writing theories, attending midnight releases, solving the puzzles on Jo's website, reading the new books in one sitting. I have enjoyed the supplementary material, hoped to visit the theme park, looked forward to the Fantastic Beasts films. This play is the one and only aspect of the Harry Potter franchise that has been a major disappointment to me. First, I want to address the format. Many complaints are being directed at the script format being difficult to read. This does not bother me. This story was intended as a play and I am grateful that the script was made available to the public. It is meant to be brought to life on the stage rather than in the reader's mind, and there are inherent limitations that come with that. However, when it came to the story, I was not impressed. Generally, I felt that it read like fanfiction, and not even the best fanfiction. While I enjoyed the little nostalgic nods placed throughout the story, I found that the characters I love were lost, the plot was lacking and even problematic, and Rowling's well thought-out version of time travel was ruined. I could say a lot more but I want to avoid specifics/spoilers, so suffice it to say that I will *not* be considering this play a part of the Harry Potter canon.",TRUE,children

But messing with the main storyline? Ignoring plot points that are now set in stone for Potterheads is lazy writing. I don't care if there are a million versions of reality: there are things that make you who you are no matter the circumstances, and taking a hero and turning him into a villain for the most pedestrian reason is beyond infuriating.

As I was reading it, I kept thinking that it felt like I was reading bad fanfiction. I can't enumerate all the plotholes and character issues, but here are some highlights SPOILER ALERT: The reason that time travel works for me in PoA is that it is abundantly clear that Harry and Hermione were always there - there was never an alternate timeline or alternate universe. As Harry says, he knew he could cast the patronus because he had already done it. This is not the case in TCC. And having saved two extra magical time turners? I could not suspend my disbelief for that. On a related note, it seemed that many of the magical laws that had been established in 1-7 were ignored, such as taking a month to brew polyjuice potion. And transforming Harry to look like Voldemort, then having the transformation wear off? And don't get me started on the character assassinations. Ron was like a caricature of himself, oafish and drunk. And Voldemort having a secret child??? It would have been much more believable to have the enemy be a Death Eater who remained in hiding. END SPOILERS To be fair, there were parts that I thought how cool this must look on stage.

The internally inconsistent logic (Scorpius and Albus are smart enough to give their father a message in the future...but not smart enough to realize the sheer stupidity of changing a significant historic event?) combined with an almost comedic, eye-roll-inducing villain made it clear that this play is written for kids and pre-teens who probably never even read the original books. Releasing a book with ""Harry Potter and the..."" in the title, with JK Rowling's name on the cover gave me certain expectations, none of which were met.

That being said, if it were possible for someone to go back in time to save Cedric...he wouldn't have died in the first place! This book made me hate time travel plots even more. It is a weak premise to base a book on. I can't believe JKR allowed this trash to have her name associated with it. If she wanted this story told she should have written it herself in a well thought out book format that didn't have gigantic plot holes and stay true to characters. I'm sure forty year old Harry is different from sixteen year old Harry, but come on! The play format was very distracting up me. I haven't read a play since high school.

So there's that. I can't go in depth too much about what I hated without giving any spoilers, but I will say I don't think the tone was consistent with Rowling's style of writing at all (yes, I knew it was a play and I know plays read differently, blah, blah, blah. I just feel this way, OK?). I thought the story line was completely absurd (YES EVEN IN A FICTIONAL WORLD OF MAGIC) and the plot relied too much on old played out themes that have already been explored in numerous other works.

The piece reads like a glorified Fan Fiction. The characters, both old and new, are one-dimensional compared to how they're represented in the original seven Harry Potter books. There are a number of sins I could mention, but the clincher was definitely Snape smiling in an alternate reality. And he wasn't even smiling because of someone else's pain!

So, like most Potter fans I was thirsty for more Potter, and bought this book the day it came out to start reading it. I noticed immediately that this is not Harry Potter. This feels like a half baked fanfic written by someone who watched the first two movies and then stopped caring about Harry Potter until they were asked to write this ten years later. Nothing makes sense. They even start with a scene that was ALREADY written and managed to mess it up. They change things all over the place, and it's honestly just a story that never needed to be told. There are so many tales in the Potter universe that would be amazing to read about and watch. This is a prime example of ""Be careful what you wish for"" and ""Sometimes more is not better"".

However, telling Albus he wished he wasn't his son? No. Never. Those words would not come out of Harry's mouth, not matter how provoked. Rose being prejudiced towards Scorpius? ROSE WEASLEY, the spawn of Ron and Hermione? They would have taught her to NEVER judge based on house, I feel that she would never behave like that, shunning her own cousin just because he wanted to be friends with Scorpius. You're trying to tell me Draco Malfoy would be okay with his son befriending a Potter, and would have taught his son as much, but Hermione/Ron did not pass this along to Rose? Hermione was not her normal witty self, Ron did at least have some humorous moments - but Harry was just so off. Shunning family for work, telling Albus he couldn't be friends with Scorpius, his BEST FRIEND. That is something Harry would NEVER do. He knows the importance of friendship more than anyone! That is practically the whole point of the books. I just don't believe it. Don't get me started on Voldemort having a daughter... He was never the type to be interested in procreating. I guess I could look over this, maybe he wanted to pass on his name, WHATEVER, but the fact that she is just kept hidden for years, and reemerges as Amos Diggory's nurse... why wasn't Harry's scar hurting the whole time? Why did he just now start to feel her presence? Why on earth would she choose to save Cedric in order to save Voldemort?! There are so many other ways she could have done that, much CLEANER ways, that perhaps wouldn't spawn a million different alternate timelines. And the time turner.. not even freaking canon, although I guess now I am supposed to consider it canon - going back in time as much as you want apparently, not to mention all of the things that doing that would change, and the fact that some people even had problems with how the third book handled messing with time. WHY CHOOSE THAT AS A PLOT? It's so hard to believe even when done properly. There are INFINITE other possibilities (as many other, BETTER fan fictions have explored). They could have done such great things with the story of Harry's kids. Instead they did this. And Cedric becoming a death eater? Because he got humiliated at the triwizard tournament? HAS THE AUTHOR EVEN READ HARRY POTTER? Cedric was a purely GOOD human being, he would NEVER go to the dark side, especially over something so trivial. I don't even know if Cedric had the ability to feel humiliation, he was so confident in himself and his abilities. The fact that the entire plot of the book rests on him becoming a death eater like that is so ridiculous, it makes me sick to my stomach. He would've made a joke out of it and moved on, he didn't care if he won the tournament. I cannot believe this book was allowed to exist. There were a very few select moments that I did enjoy. The flash of Hagrid as he picked Harry up out from Godric's Hollow (but, then again, anything involving Hagrid makes me melt). The fact that Albus was sorted into Slytherin was great, and the fact that Scorpius had a crush on Rose was great as well. Hermione being Minister of magic has long been my head canon. I admit I did shed some tears when Harry watched his parent's die, but only because that's a sad moment from the actual books. I don't like that he was there to witness it, along with all his friends and Draco. He saw it in his dreams, that should've been enough. There were some funny moments, mostly from Ron or Scorpius, but other than that, I really find nothing redeemable. So, so disappointed.",TRUE,children

It was either going to be amazing or absolutely horrible. This was the latter. If I could give it half a star, I would. I went into this read with no expectations, but was still left with disappointment. Firstly, this books reads like fanfiction and not even the good kind. The original characters (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) were so unlike themselves it was hard to picture them as the same characters I loved in the series. Ron is now basically the not funny dad always trying to play jokes, Hermione seems cold and distant, and Harry...well, he's just not Harry. The story line is also just complete garbage. Without spoiling the book, THERE IS NO WAY THIS PLOT MAKES ANY SENSE AND WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED!!! All in all, this book might as well have been of a completely different universe.

Forced myself to finish and while I enjoyed the concept and understand it's in play format just got overwhelmed by the lack of continuity. Surely Rowling did not put much effort into this. The concept was good but the road was full of potholes. It seems like she fell into the trap of thinking anything will do so why put much effort into it. RIP Harry Potter.

I feel like J.K. Rowling decided to have a contest where she had fans write the last story, and then would pick the best one as the winner while editing and changing it for inconsistencies. She then got ridiculously lazy, scattered the entries all over the floor, threw a dart up in the air, slapped her name on the first script it hit without even looking at it, and had it published. It did not hit a good one. JK Rowling, you've officially sold out. The only redeeming quality about this entire book is that it is in play form, meaning there is very little writing, meaning you will waste fewer hours of your life reading it (think tearing off a bandaid on a particularly nasty wound.)",TRUE,children

Fans of the books will be very disappointed in the script. Firstly, it's not actually a novel (duh) and it doesn't read like one (also duh). Many will blame the format for the departure from her past quality and while it clearly didn't do Rowling et. al. any favors, this reads like fan-fiction. Start to finish. The new characters, the changes to old characters, the plot, the concept - all of them scream ""fan-fiction"" and not even good fan-fiction. The key points of the story just don't fit the universe. It's uncomfortable to read this if you're deep into the original stories. You'll struggle to fit the actions of characters into what you know of them. So much of the plot feels like a retread of old material and not just flashbacks but the themes. This didn't add anything new to the Harry Potter universe. At least, nothing that we couldn't have lived without. There are a few brief moments that feel like the wizarding world we all know and love but sadly, they are few and far between. Fans of Harry Potter do owe it to themselves to read the story but I strongly recommend that you lock this tale far far away from your memory of the 7 books.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Tragically disappointing,31,"At best, this is a poorly written fanfiction. I have been a longtime Harry Potter fan. I read the books several times a year when I get the chance, and I collect memorabilia. It was a crucial part of my childhood and, as such, I was excited and hopeful for this latest edition. Although I went into this book knowing that it was A) not written by JK Rowling and B) not in its traditional format, but a play, I had high expectations that it would be as magical and titillating as the series has always been for me given that Rowling endorsed it herself and has given it high praise. How wrong I was. The characters have been assassinated. Plot holes rob this story of any cohesion. Blatant inaccuracies exist within its pages that force us to deviate so far from what we know to be true in the original novels - basic ideas such as how magic works, how potions work, how time works. Ideas that have been dissected and discussed by fans across the world and confirmed by JK Rowling herself only to be thrown to the side in this sorry excuse for a continuation of Harry Potter. On principle, I refuse to include spoilers in this post. If you would like to read this book, be my guest. In fact, I encourage it so that you, too, can understand where the negative reviews are coming from. I have been a longtime supporter and defender of Rowling and continued endeavors to keep the Harry Potter world alive and I will not write off the series, or her, with the reveal of this catastrophe. However, I cannot support this play. I cannot support this playscript. I cannot, in any way, support the idea that this content is considered canon in the Harry Potter universe, as not only is it a contrived and immature plot, but also the bulk of the book and its ideas go against everything that we already know to be true and confirmed by Rowling herself. I will support future Potter projects that Rowling has written herself, however, this may be the last time that I pick up anything that was written by another and endorsed by her. This is not something that I would ever enjoy picking up and reading again, nor is it something that I want to see on the stage. I am sure the very talented and accomplished actors who will be performing it are stunning in their performance, but the story is so poorly written that I am not sure their talent can save the show alone.",TRUE,children

I had not realized at first this would be in screen play format, which is really annoying and difficult to read-my fault for not paying attention to that. I had to force myself to get through it.The plot is weak and has holes, too many questions left unanswered, the story was rushed, and the characters actions were out of character (primarily Harry.) It just seemed as if the attention to detail and rich storytelling that we are accustomed to with Rowling were missing. This one missed the mark. I'm gonna pretend I didn't read it now and hope one day I have enough money to travel to London for the express purpose of seeing the play in person. (lol!)",TRUE,children

Ummm. No. And these are just a few examples in this drivel that are not in any way previously established in the original books or movies. The ONLY exception is when Snape makes an appearance in the play. How they portray him is in line with his attributed personality traits. Oh but this takes place 19 years after the books which would account for a change in personality, right? I don't buy it and I wish I hadn't bought this.

133821666X,1.0,A Ranting Review (SPOILERS),5,"First of all, as a life-long theatre lover, I have read many, many plays. So I understand that they are not meant to read like a novel. Obviously, they are best experienced on stage. That said, I have loved dozens of plays that I haven't been able to see. I was hoping this was going to be one of those, too. It wasn't. From the start, it felt choppy and disconnected. The characters we know and love said and did things entirely out of character, especially Harry. Ginny hardly had a role at all, and all the fierceness has apparently faded. The plot was subpar. I have literally read the same plot in fanfiction, and I'm pretty sure they were better quality. It felt so contrived. I was hoping for a new villain, a new obstacle. Instead, the writers used time-turners to dredge up the same villain we spent seven books fighting and destroying. And let's talk about those time-turners. (SPOILERS) How convenient that an extra special time turner just happened to be created, and that Malfoy just happened to have one too. So. Contrived. But the thing that bothered me the most? Hermione. Hermione is married to Ron, and at the start of the play is Minister of Magic. She's brilliant and powerful, as expected, although I admit I was disappointed that she was in politics after all. So the kids go back in time, and screw some stuff up, and Hermione and Ron's futures get messed up and they don't end up together. Fine. I never liked them together. But wait. What happens if Hermione doesn't marry Ron? She is a brilliant witch, an independent and fierce woman, so she is still wildly successful, right? NOPE. She ends up as a Snape-like teacher, cruel to her students, bitter and angry about life, with no prospects. WHAT. THE. HELL. That is NOT Hermione, and the writing of one of the best female characters in fantasy did not feel like Rowling at all. In short, save your money. This story was the worst.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,HP books are a billion times better than HP movies which are a billion times better than the Cursed Child,5,"Ok when I first read this book the minute it was released I thought I liked it. But that's because I had hyped myself up and wanted to love it SO MUCH that I basically forced myself to. I'm OBSESSED with everything Harry Potter, and I mean OBSESSED. So basically if I didn't love this I felt like I was betraying my favorite series in the whole world. Slowly after the initial reading when I started actually analyzing and thinking about what I just read, I realized what an absolute piece of trash it is as far as a Harry Potter story goes. The characters were literally not even remotely similar to the characters we know and love. The story was just one big giant plot hole and inconsistency. I don't care that it was written in play form, I knew ahead of time that this was a screenplay for the play. I'm talking about the story itself which is horrible and terrible and NOTHING like Harry Potter. So before this turns into a pages long rant, I'll stop myself. This is what I think of this story: Compared to the ACTUAL Harry Potter series, it's TRASH. BUT so are the movies compared to the books (not anywhere near as much trash as the Cursed Child though.) So basically while I pretty much hate this story, I take it with a grain of salt because there is a TON of stuff I hate about the movies too. So I would never destroy this book (I collect EVERYTHING I can HP so it's still part of the collection) and honestly I might see the play just to experience that because I'll be in New York next year when it starts on Broadway. But unless you are like me and pretty much compulsively by HP stuff just to add to your collection, don't even bother. And I pretty much worship anything that comes out of JK's mouth but I don't care what she says, the Cursed Child will NEVER be canon. So in summary: the Harry Potter books are a billion times better than the Harry Potter movies which are a billion times better than the Cursed Child.",TRUE,children

I stopped reading it at 7% because I hated it, but then I went back to it. I should have left it. It was bad fan fiction. I'm sorry I wasted my time and money. It was disjointed and written terribly, and that had nothing to do with the fact that it was written as a play. The grammar was awful. Nothing was explained. This was the stupidest thing I've ever read, and I have read Twilight, Fifty Shades of Grey, and lots of fan fiction. Hermoine was not believable as the Minister OF Magic (they kept calling it the Minister FOR Magic). Harry was an awful father, just annoying, and a very weak character. Ginny was not the spit fire she is supposed to be. Ron was an oaf and not one bit funny. Albus was an ass. The only characters I liked were Draco and Scorpious. Draco was how I wanted him to be when he grew up. The discourse between Harry and Dumbledore is ridiculous and stupid. Dumbledore crying in his portrait? Give me a break. As for that pregnancy, there is no way that Draco would not have known about it, and I didn't get the impression that he was lying. But then, since nothing else was explained, maybe he was lying. In this ""book,"" polyjuice potion can be made instantly instead of over a course of one month, and third years are taught about the patronus charm.

Why is Ron so obnoxious and unintelligent? Why would Hermione stay with such a husband? Why is any of his happening to people we do not like or know at all?

133821666X,1.0,Heartbreaking for true Potter fans,7,"(no spoilers in this, I haven't actually finished the book and I've already made me decision on it) I'm heartbroken to be writing this.. I cannot tell you how big a part of my life the Harry Potter series has been. To say I adore it isn't enough. So The Cursed Child is killing me. It's so bad. I tried so hard to tell myself that it's a play, it has to be a little different, they can't have every little detail and every single character. And I could get over missing details and characters. What I can't get over is the out right absurdity and silliness. I know it sounds like a crazy thing to say about a series about magic, but it's true. In the original series Rowling could write about unicorns and flying broom sticks and magical ways of being immortal, and she did it in a way that made you feel it was possible, made you feel like you could really be a part of that world. This book doesn't have that. Instead it has me shaking my head and getting irritated at how little it follows the concrete facts Rowling worked so hard to establish. It always amazed me how she wrote a series over several years and everything tied in so well together; this book just doesn't have that. The first part I found ridiculous was the trolley witch. Suddenly she's this hundreds of years old being whose food turns into bombs and can turn her hands into spikes but apparently has no means of stopping two boys who are supposed to be bad at magic (they can't do spells well until they practice them, like twice, and suddenly they can. They also never get in trouble for doing magic outside of school) from jumping off the train. Then there's the 'engorgio' charm. It sounds like a small detail but it really bugs me. They use it to engorge someone's head and he floats away. In the original series engorgio was used to make things bigger, not fill them with helium. As I said, it was something so normal in the original series, and it just gets completely skewed in this, and it's an example of this kind of thing happening multiple times. Another thing I can't stand is the time turner. A man wants Harry to go back before Voldemort's return to power and save his son's life. This so greatly diminishes everything that was established in earlier books about time turners and even about Harry's relationship with this man. There are so many other examples of things that just don't fit into the Harry Potter world, but the worst thing about reading this is that these characters just aren't the same. These aren't the characters we fell in love with. Ron's just a moron, I can't get a grasp on who Harry is at all, and with Draco it's like they can't make up their minds about if he's supposed to be nice or a jerk. You would expect Rose, with a laid back father, loving mother, and close nit family to be a good person, but she's nothing but a little snob. Honestly with the huge Weasley family and all the others Harry's surrounded himself with, you just expect them all to be close nit and loving, but that's just no the case and it's so sad. The deeper into this book I get, the more it feels like a fanfiction written by a juvenile, and the more I feel like it has to be a joke. It's sad for those of us who have stuck loyally by this series to see Rowling willingly put her name on something that so clearly undermines the series she worked hard to create.

Like many others, I question how much Rowling contributed to this and I agree that it is like a horrible fanfiction. A Very Potter Music, a parody, is more canon to the fans of Harry Potter than this debacle. A few reasons that this dismays me go as follows (Please, excuse the spoilers): 1. JK Rowling has admitted her folly with time turners. Yet, they were the main plot device in this book. It was almost used to explain why one could not have used them to go back in time to stop Voldemort. 2. The characters were disastrous. a. Harry Potter, who has completely mistreated by his aunt, uncle, and cousin would never have treated his son so shamefully. b. Ron was used as a comic relief and a joke. c. Hermione wasn't Harry's best friend; Ron was. However, Harry treated her as such. d. There are more, but I don't have time. 3. Bellatrix was never pregnant which makes the whole plot moot. Anyway, if you must ruin your Harry Potter experience, please rent it from the library.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Wish I had a Time-Turner to Unread This,6,"*Some spoilers* I get that this is a script for a play and that you need to SEE it to really get into the world of Harry Potter again. I get that there are new characters and I am asked to get to know and love them from a bare-bones script whereas I spent years learning and loving the original characters. What I DON'T get is why almost every one is so damn unlikable. Albus is as annoying as Harry circa Order of the Phoenix with his angst. Ron--on paper--is a caricature of his former self: his corniness is highlighted in a less than enduring way, his mediocrity more glaring than ever. Hermione seems to be an ineffective leader and hardly believable as the head of the magical world. Harry is just--awful, just awful. Draco suddenly became overly emotional and unlike the haughty, cold British boy I loved before. Scorpius is the saving grace and pretty much the only likeable person. And then there are the glaring plot holes...why is Cedric Diggory only one awful event away from becoming one of the worst people ever? His honor, valor, chivalry, and fairness are what his character was about--so one bad day turns him into a demon for all time? No. Unconvincing. Why--WHY--if the Malfoys had real Time-Turners, wouldn't they have gone back and achieved their plans before? Or if they acquired them after Voldemort's fall, they still could have gone back in time and made Draco a hero--which is befitting of their prideful ways and would have been pretty interesting. The love-child with Bellatrix and Voldemort is just wrong. Of course we knew Bellatrix was panting after him, but Voldemort seemed to be apart from lust of any kind for a woman. It is just awkward and disgusting. It also seems like Bellatrix would have piped up about such a thing prior to the war, or even any of the Malfoys. It also seems that the baby would have been made into another Horcrux if she was so top secret. Finally, perhaps the most annoying thing of all to me, is the just plain weirdness of some things. There seems to be a lot more SPOKEN emotion in the play. In all 7 of the original books, none of the characters say ""I love you"" or anything. Their love is implied and demonstrated in their actions and this somehow makes it more realistic than mushy words, however in this play they are all about the mushy sentiments and it is just out of character for them. And there is this one scene with Albus--who is 14--disguised as Ron with the aid of polyjuice potion is trying to distract Hermione from going inside of her office and is practically making out with her and actually says he wants to have another baby with her. Ew. I would see the play if I am ever in London, or if it travels to the US, but only to see if it redeems itself somehow in some measure. It will never be right or perfect and I wish I had a time-turner so I can unread this crap and go back to platform 9 3/4 to see a bright-eyed 11 year old Albus off on the train and leave the saga there.",TRUE,children

133821666X,1.0,Disappointed,1,"Sigh. I am an avid reader and a huge fan of Harry Potter. J.K Rawlings's well thought out original series is one of my favorites. This composition was just bad. Of all the rich possibilities to consider, to use a cliche plot device and rehash the old storyline was just disappointing. In fact, it was ridiculous to think that you-know-who would have a child. It comes off as a poorly written play designed purely to cash in on the Harry Potter legacy. Read it if you want, but be prepared to be disappointed.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Epic Fail!,45,"A total failure : The dialogue is stiff and wooden, our heros reduced to pitiful caricatures rather than believable older versions of themselves. At times, Albus and Scorpius act and sound years older than their parents. Shabby attempts to insert humor fell flat while frantic action scenes reminded me of those I have seen in poorly directed Chinese Kung- Fu movies. Even more disturbing is that all the critics' accolades remind me of the old ""Emperor's New Clothes"" Tale. Everyone praising something absurd for fear of being criticized by the people around them. Have we really become so desperate for another chapter in Harry's life that we'll settle for whatever is thrown at us? For me, this is a prime example of greedy moguls in the movie industry (because of course a movie is going to be in the works eventually,... with the probable addition of a talking pet sidekick... a la Donkey or Jiminy cricket) twisting old beloved traditional fairytales into scenes of dancing, singing mice and teapots that talk, while bullying their target market into agreeing with so-called experts who are actually secretly profiting in some way from promoting the offered dribble. That Rowling put her seal of approval on this play shocks me. For me, Harry's adventure ends firmly on platform 9 3/4 as he sends Albus off to Hogwarts. Frankly, I think Rowling owes us an apology. And Amazon? I want my money back!",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,Lazy writing,6,"SPOILERS This was a disappointment. Like many other reviewers, I am a true fan, and have loved all things Potter. The basic premise of this story was intriguing, but the writing, particularly the dialogue, is just so poor. Yes, I know it's a play, and based in the stage direction, I would imagine the effects are stunning in the theater, but the Potter canon has always been about the characters. The trite dialogue simply leaves them flat. Worse: there is no true humor in this story, other than using Ron as some sort of slapstick comic relief. (I don't remember Ron being as clumsy or unintelligent as this character is drawn.) Many of the plot devices are recycled from other media, as well. The whole story with the underground movement came straight from the last Shrek movie, although it does explain some of the casting choices. The most incongruous of these devices is the idea that Delphi is the love child of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Unless Voldemort raped Bellatrix as some kind of punishment, the idea of his being intimate with anyone directly contradicts his whole purpose. He would also be super careful NOT to have progeny, as he would not want to be attached to anything. Voldemort is a creature that expects to live forever as the most powerful being: he does not want attachments or competition. When reading this, I could see the dramatic visual appeal, but. in the end, I could not get past how the dialogue seemed to be lifted straight from a badly written made for tv Disney movie. These characters are British, yet their slang is too American. There is simply too little Rowling here.",TRUE,children

The plot is terrible and full of holes, and there are so many continuity errors I can't even list them all. The big twist makes no sense and it doesn't even seem remotely possible that the characters wouldn't have known about it during DH.

In HP original series it took 1800+ pages to describe HP 4 years in Hogwarts. Here for his son it took - guess how many?-- 10! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, TEN pages! 10 pages for 4 years. Still, it could have been good if there were no such horrible mistake which make me think that the authors consider readers/audience complete idiots.

That wasn't an issue for me as I'm familiar with script format. It was the story itself that got to me. It felt like it took all the happiness of the original books and epilogue, pulled it out of you, threw it in the mud, stomped on it, and shoved the mess back in where your fond memories were. It is not fun. It is depressing. It feels more like crappy fanfiction rather than a JK Rowling story. The fact that she is not the sole writer is very clear here. I really wonder how much she contributed herself beyond checking it over and putting her name on it. There were cannon errors and characters acted out of their norm (even given the fact they are now adults). Honestly, if I could Obliviate this from my memory and end with book 7, I'd be happy.

Usually I can find positives in any work of literature but this one is a record for me. If you are thinking of buying this book please think before you purchase.

I even write fanfiction myself. A lot of people like to say that those who don't like it don't understand that it's a play and not a novel. As an English Literature major I know how to appreciate a play, this just fails on so many levels.

However, by all means buy it for yourself and decide for yourself, while I don't like it, I read through it rather quickly and it was fun to read (and I absolutely love Albus and Scorpius in this) so I'm not trying to discourage anyone from reading this but don't go into it expecting it to be like what you're used to.",TRUE,children

I preordered this book and like others excitedly waited for it's release. Then it gets here and I read it. I'm not going to fully break down all of the disappointments in it, but say I whole hardly agree with most of the things that folks had to say about it. The story itself didn't have that HP feel to it. It just felt rushed. The main plot idea of the story goes against the original ideas and character understanding or our understanding of the characters. I know people can change as the grow up, but some of it was just too much. Now, the plot itself if they'd done it differently, but the person they used was impossible based on the original stories.

133821666X,1.0,Shameful... such a letdown!,52,"SPOILER FREE There were so many bad decisions that went into making this it's hard to believe the person who wrote the finely crafted interlocking world of the original books was involved in any way. First, why on earth would you issue the final episode in the form of a play? People keep saying ""well it's probably better on stage"". Well, the fan base is an ardent worldwide group of novel readers. Choosing to only show the true version of the story to ONE room of people in one place at a time was a just a poor choice. Everyone else gets cold and frankly ridiculous sounding stage directions instead of pages of rich description from one of the greatest writers of the century. Second, and much more importantly, this story line is so bad it's actually gut-wrenching. As a huge long time potter it was so hard and painful to read. I don't usually like being critical or snobbish about movies or books. I try to enjoy them for what they are and not dissect them 100 different ways. That being said this script was so full of plot holes and inconsistencies it's actually hard to believe JK ever read it. Books can and will be written about the problems with this story line. It is completely incompatible with the world the original 1~7 books established. I would provide examples but don't have it in me to open the book again. The motives and actions of many of the characters make absolutely no sense at all. The decisions of both the protagonists and the main villain are so absurd and illogical that the only explanation is plot convenience to take the audience to revisit an old story.

I'm also refusing to consider in cannon as it was not JKR herself who penned. What they did to the INTEGRITY of these characters. I'm sick over it. The entire 7 book series was about friendship, love and loyalty, and Harry knew that; and most importantly, knew that's what made him different from V. You're telling me, he, Ron and Herm didn't continue to live and instil those values in their children? Rose was a bully, who was prejudice against someone without knowing them first. Harry would never said he wished his kid wasn't his, or sacrificed his kid's only friendship over gosip. Harry wouldn't have choosen work over time with his family, which after all he'd been through WAS ALL HE EVER WANTED. If someone were to ask me, what is your favorite thing about Harry Potter?, I would hands down reply: Harry Potter's moral integrity, that is the heart of the series. It's his choosing to sacrifice himself for what is good. It's choosing friendship over suspicion. It's a defiant effort to turn towards the pain of loving and losing, then choosing not to love at all. It's choosing to do what right, and best for others even when it hurts, is inconvenient, or scary. It's fighting for truth and justice, even when you're the only one doing it. And when you move away from those central themes, the integrity of who we know Harry (and friends) to have PROVEN himself to be, you destroy Harry Potter and all that he stood for for 7 books. This new book is the worst kind of trash, the one that destroys the soul of our hero. Also, what they did to calm, measured, quirky, wise Dumbledore, making him a weepy, rude mess, who spoke in cliches, issuing a completely unnecessary ""apology"" to why Harry was at the Dursleys, when Dumbledore had already apologized profusely for that in HP5 AND severely told off the Dursleys in HP6 for their abusive behavior! It was just phony emotional porn! And Ron's a proper idiot who got drunk during his wedding?! He would have never disrespected Hermione like that. Hermione was neither clever, nor charming; she didn't come up with hardly any solutions. And what a weak, floppy mess Harry was during the fight scene?! His 16 year old self could have fought better.

The story is not different from any other time-travel stories in any significant way. I don't know about anyone else, but I could totally predict what happens next when reading it.

133821666X,1.0,VERY DISAPPOINTED - Story is ridiculous and there are way too many plot holes,15,"I have been reading Harry Potter since the first book came out and am a huge fan. I loved the books and read them at least 5 times each (probably more). I wanted to like this book but it was really hard for me to finish because it was so bad. I used to read the original Harry Potter books nonstop until I finished them. I read the last book for 10 hours straight and that was around 900 pages. It's two weeks after I got this book and I can't even get myself to finish the last 50 pages of this book. It's obviously not written by JK Rowling and the whole story is ridiculous. The rules that JK Rowling set up for going back in time in the Prisoner of Azkaban somehow don't apply in this book. Ron and Harry don't even appear to be the same characters. Ron somehow turned really funny and Harry is a bad dad that doesn't understand his kid. The Harry that I know from the original books would have got to know his kid and his kid wouldn't resent him for no reason. Also, there's NO WAY that Voldemort would have had a kid. He couldn't love and I cant imagine him liking anyone touching him. This book feels like fantasy when the other books felt real. I hope that JKR contributed very little to this because of how poorly it is written. If she contributed even 5% of this storyline, I am very disappointed in how this story of Harry's life and his children's life are going. If JKR wanted to create a play, she should have done a story about the Marauders at Hogwarts or during the first war against Voldemort. She could have even done a story about the Harry's kids at Hogwarts facing other evils but to create a child of Voldemort feels fake and like the story just needed a villain and used almost the same one as all the other books. I am very disappointed. I wish this book had never come out at this point because it puts a damper on the original books. I'm going to live in denial and pretend that this didn't come out and this isn't the future for the Wizarding World.

I truly believe if JK Rowling has written this story by herself the result would've kept with the beauty and wonderment of the Harry Potter universe. BUT as she did not, this miserable embarrassment of a story is something that I am chalking up as an insult to the Harry Potter character and dumping from my memory. Of course some JK Rowling sheep will love it and cheer for a encore but the reality of it is that the three wonderfully amazing children who saved the world and banded together grew up to be stupid, hateful adults who speak like 12 year olds?

I actually had to walk away from the book on several occasions because I became so annoyed with their poor depiction of original characters. There were also several parts/twists of the story that I felt were not believable because they did not coincide with the details/explanations we know from the original series, i.e. Delphi's parents, Harry's lack of knowledge about Dumbledore's feelings, etc. I love the Harry Potter series, but regret ruining it with this story.

Edgar Rice Burroughs beginning writing Tarzan, John Carter of Mars, At the Earth's Core, etc. when, as a struggling salesman, he read the serial novels in magazines, and said, ""I can write something this bad!"" This is how I feel about the HP and the Cursed Child script - even I could have written something this terrible! The characters were one dimensional distortions of the ones we know form the HP novels, the dialogue was shallow and insufferable, and the plot entirely predictable given the THOUSANDS of previous works dealing with the consequences of time travel. There is absolutely nothing original here, and it has all been done, and better done, by many, many others. It was terribly boring, and I found myself wondering if the writer(s) were paid by the word, because it was the ""script that would not die!"" I thought it would never end! I couldn't stand it, and I don't know how JKR would have allowed her name to appear on it. The entire story deserved 30 pages or less for the entire plot (a very weak one) to have been written, and, frankly, I think should have never been written. The ""magic"" was all a re-do of prior stuff all mashed up and contrived. The characters were NOT the ones from the novels. The story line was a boring re-do of countless time travel stories. The plot moved forward at the speed of a receding glacier. I only wish I could sell my Kindle version at a used book store, but, alas, I can't, and can only delete from my devices.

The writing is not complex or layered, possibly because of the screenplay format.

When I discovered there was more in the Harry Potter series, a play script, I was extremely excited, thinking I could continue my friendship with the characters in Harry Potter. When I discovered it was written by others then J.K. Rowling I was hesitant. As a good author she has a unique writing style and it is almost always impossible to replicate a style that is not your own. I was afraid there would be a stark contrast to the original books, and it would just ruin the Harry Potter world. I was right. This script is terrible! It is a mistake. It is so different from the actual books! The characters are flat and opaque, they have no personality and no complexity!! The plot is unnessacary and silly. It seems they slapped J.K. Rowlings name on it to sell it and ride on her talent. The reason this script was a mistake is because they tried to build on something that wasn't their's to build, use characters they didn't develop, and try to continue a saga they didn't start!

Also, I can't believe that anyone as nasty as Rose could be the child of Ron and Hermione. The new characters introduced are one dimensional. Surprisingly, the bright spot is the Malfoys. It's nice to see some personal growth. Second, they contradict the way time-turners work as described in POA. In that book, Harry and Hermione go back and time to make sure events played out exactly as they did the first time. In the Cursed Child, they play fast and loose with the time line to create some highly implausible scenarios. Third, without spoiling too much, they refer to things that take place during the timeline of the novels that simply couldn't have happened.

The plot is centered around time travel, quite possibly the most cringeworthy storyline cliché imaginable and completely passes over the essence of the series in the first place. Throughout the first few acts the reader is constantly being jerked around in a half-assed attempt to catch them up to speed, and the sparse snapshots of life that we are shown do little to rival the sentiment of merely watching an episode of Full House. I'm thoroughly convinced that anybody who rushes to the defense of this book is so intransigently entrenched in fandom that they couldn't work past the guilt of having grown up with Harry Potter to even consider slandering this abomination to an incredible series.

It is so bad, I would give it negative stars if I could. Let me start by saying that I hated the epilogue at the end of book 7. JK should have never written it; the names that she gave to Harry's children are cheesy and lame, pairing up the couples like she did left so little to the imagination. She should have just let it end. That's where this comes in; the Cursed Child shows that JK doesn't seem to care about her fans, more like the amount of money her franchise is making. There was little to no character development throughout the play - even with the characters we know and love! The plot is terribly constructed with SO many holes in it. Poorly edited, as well. Spelling and grammatical errors abound. I understand that this play is probably very quite captivating on stage with special effects and superb acting, however this DOES NOT translate well into print. I can't stress that enough. Any action is not developed well enough; I had a hard time following large parts that weren't dialogue. ~~~~~SPOILERS BELOW~~~~~ The biggest problems I had: - Throughout the script, parts of dialogue are lifted from the books. This happens so often that it is redundant. Unoriginal. - Dumbledore and Harry's conversation seemed so surface, emotions so forced. Dumbledore crying, really? Harry talking about Daddy issues? No. Dumbledore's appearance was unnecessary and annoying. - Everything so conveniently falls into the hands of Albus and Scorpius. Need gillyweed? No problem! Polyjuice potion? Can be concocted in a minute, when in Chamber of Secrets it is clear that it takes a month to brew. Bathilda Bagshots house with the doors unlocked? Perfect. Draco Malfoy just *happening* to have an extra timeturner? PLEASE. Give me a break. - Voldemorts daughter. It doesn't work! Everyone would have known if Bellatrix was pregnant, that's not something she could have just hidden. Ridiculous. There's so much more but I don't want to go on because, just like reading this book, it's a complete waste of my time. I hate JK Rowling for endorsing this pathetic piece of fanfiction.

Ron is portrayed as a complete goof with no charm. In fact the whole original cast seems to have completely changed with Ginny the only one who turned out even remotely respectable. The hard part is this is a script. This was written to be depicted by actors and actresses and therefore is lacking detail and strong character development.

133821666X,1.0,D for Dreadful,38,"D for Dreadful. I read the reviews but didn't think much of all the one-stars. I figured hardcore Harry Potter fans were just being too harsh in reviewing after years of inventing their own futures for all the beloved characters. I was so wrong. I want to stress that I really really wanted to like this addition to the Harry Potter canon. I even wanted to read it quickly so I could get to Amazon to leave a great review, defending the plot and characters. Unfortunately, it truly did fall short in my eyes. The characters don't seem like themselves, the plot seems rushed and full of holes, and there are so many unnecessary and incompatible story inclusions that seem incorporated just to be able to revisit old characters. I was, regrettably, disappointed. SPOILERS ----> First, I agree with many of the comments left here in that having Albus Potter be sorted into Slytherin was great. However, there was no explanation of why and no vindication for Slytherin House either. I would have hoped that Slytherin was finally shown in good light, but this did not really happen either. There were hardly any signs of ambition or leadership in Albus or Scorpius. How did they end up in Slytherin, anyway? Also, why was there no mention of Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff? The idea that Albus and Scorpius wouldn't understand (or care about) the consequences of using a time turner to change a significant historical event at the age of 14 is preposterous. Even if Scorpius was mildly tempted just to follow his friend, he would be smart enough to try to dissuade Albus from actually making any changes in history. He is portrayed as smart like Hermione, but this certainly didn't fit. And to try to set things right by doing it a second time? And on top of that, doing something entirely different that second time hoping it would put things back in order?! Please. The biggest plot issue I had was that Voldemort has a child, and with Bellatrix Lestrange before the Battle of Hogwarts, no less. We saw Bellatrix in book 7 in detail the year before she died. As someone pointed out, the idea that she was pregnant while fighting Harry, Ron, and Hermione in Malfoy Manor and no one notice is absurd. Maybe I'm missing something in the timeline on this one. Also, Voldemort would have planned much better than to leave his descendant with no proper care or plan for the future. Voldemort took every precaution and went further than any wizard known in history to assure his immortality. He would have had similar care and preparation for his plan B. Finally, there is a big issue with the characters in this story. I thought that the reviews of changing characters might be attributed to them growing into adulthood. Now, though, I really don't think so. There was a mix of odd sappy behavior and furious rages from Harry who had always been respectful of others and learned to control his emotions towards the end of the series. Hermione was preoccupied and sloppy. Ron was no longer witty or clever but included as some kind of foolish comic relief. Draco was the peaceful voice of reason. It really didn't make sense to me. As for the flashbacks, they seemed so forced and unnecessary - only existing to give the audience a chance to revisit characters. Even they were disappointing revivals, though. Dumbledore seemed emotional and unhelpful, Cedric was full of spite, and Snape was sentimental and kindhearted (even if Snape was good in the end, he was never one to get emotional - he himself states that it is a key to his Occlumency skills!). Very disappointing. <---- I could go on but why. All in all, I was let down. I expected much more than this. Perhaps it was my high expectations after so many years or re-reading the magnificent original 7 immediately before I picked this up, but I did not enjoy Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. By all means, read it since it is supposedly canon now, but don't expect to be impressed.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,"Disappointing ""8th story""",22,"I had heard the rumors of the plot before reading, but I had hoped that it was just misconstrued or that the writing would save it. It didn't. I have loved the Harry Potter books since I first read them. They were beautifully written stories that changed my life. But this script includes some mildly witty dialogue, but overall left me extremely disappointed and at times angry with the disservice it gave to the original stories. The magical theory and some of the facts they reference make no sense or are just not possible in the Harry Potter world. The time travel theory made no sense. Outside of the fact that it contradicts the way time travel worked in the books, this script contradicts itself with the way that changes in the past effects the future. The characterizations seemed inconsistent at best. There were certainly echoes of the canon characters, but not enough to be convincing. The only character with a distinct voice and viewpoint that consistently jumped off the page was Scorpius. The plot was wrought with cheap thrills and cliches. Many of the plot twists seem are reminiscent of a soap opera. There are certainly touching, funny, inspiring moments Many of the stage directions are written in a lovely way. Yet I will never be able to see it that way because the outrageous plot points and the complete disconnect with the Harry Potter series in terms of magical theory and consistent characterizations. If it had been just a magical story unrelated to the Harry Potter series, it may have been a passable read. And as a play I am sure it could be enthralling with the special effects and acting, but the story cannot stand on its own as a respectable addition to this series. Of all the stories that JK Rowling could have put her stamp of approval on as the ""eighth"" story I don't understand how this could be it. This has seriously made me forsake the image I still have of her as one my childhood heroes. When the books ended she told the fans he would not expand on the story.

First of all, being a die hard Harry Potter fan, having reading the books a dozen times in the last decade or so, having bought all of the extra books and holding J.K. Rowling to such a high standard I was extremely disappointed that her name was associated with this. It makes me feel a little better to know that she didn't actually write it, she just helped (?) come up with the general plot. It is frustrating, though, that she apparently did not even proof read?? There are so many things - big and small - that do not add up with the other books at all. The characters are barely even passable as themselves and even the terms are misspoken. ""Minister for Magic""??? It's been Minister of Magic for seven books and now it changes? Even just small things like that irk me so much because it really is as though this is a poor fan fiction that Rowling felt some need to attach her name to? The narration - although I understand the need to be in play/production format - doesn't sound remotely like her! So disappointed. Going to go re-read the books and pretend like this never happened.",TRUE,children
133821666X,1.0,For the love of fame and money...,13,"I doubt J.K. Rowling needed the extra income, and she certainly did not need this to add to her fame. The co-authors were palpably the main authors of this play, and they were riding Rowling's coattails. I love the Harry Potter books, and have found them witty, imaginative, clever, engaging, and often profound. They certainly have the potential to become lasting classics in literature, even if there are some inconsistencies and less than stellar passages in them. I also like to read stage plays, not just watching them performed on stage. I remember reading Shakespeare's plays right before attending performances - and both the reading and the performances were enjoyable in their own rights. Thus, I have no problem with the format of the story ""HP & the Cursed Child."" My problem is with the contrived story line, the character representation (in Ron's case it was particularly a misrepresentation, in light of the original series), the absence of Rowling's usual linguistic creativity, the dominantly bland lines, and that the play failed to add to the overall HP Universe. This is particularly disturbing because a typical HP book was a learning experience for the young readers: the story had deep and consistent moral message, which is missing here. In fact, the book rings hollow. Deathly hollow... I would rather neglect that this book is part of the official canon, and treat it as a mediocre unauthorized fan fiction. That would keep the integrity of the neatly complete 7-book series. With writing like this, Harry Potter would have never become a mega hit. Just one SPOILER here: Albus and Scorpius want to notify Harry about their location (time and place). Thus, they create a message they know would wind up in Harry's hands and be revealed to him in the future. To be clear, the idea (in a different version and obviously without magic) was used in Isaac Asimov's ""The End of Eternity."" I don't know whether the authors were aware of Asimov's fiction, but it is certainly one of the better known time travel novels. So, this ""major punchline"" in the story was rather predictable and unoriginal.",TRUE,children

There were occasional moments that got me but overall this was a giant let down as I had so many high hopes for the book. This was a bunch of flat characters running around in a subpar plot line that overall was completely and totally underdeveloped. If this play was rewritten as a complete book with a fleshed out storyline and characters it might be a million times better.

I have no words to express how disappointed I am. I wished I had not spent a penny in this rubbish and not wasted my time reading it.

The writing itself isn't bad, and it's formatted like a screenplay so it's a quick read. Unfortunately, that's about all positive I can say. All the characters that you know and love get completely ignored or are so out of character you might as well be reading a story about the actors who played them. The new characters (i.e. the kids of Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, etc.) get into misadventures that read like a bad fanfiction and the entire plotline (won't spoil anything) is a convoluted mess that leaves you feeling like someone confundus'd you.

Moaning Myrtle...that was the hardest to swallow. Really!?!? Malfoy, Ron and Dumbledore where also unrecognizable. I wonder if these guys even read the books? It seemed like they intentionally made the adult characters lame so the 2 young protagonist would stand out more. If that was the case they failed miserably.

I agree with other reviewers that it didn't make sense for Albus to be so clueless as to why people were staring during the Epilogue but now not only be totally aware of his father's ""legacy"", but resentful of it as well. I actually really enjoyed Scorpius' character - best part of the book, in my opinion, and I liked that Albus and Scorpius became friends. The rest is just not worth reading.

No teenage boy acts like Scorpius or Albus, and I found it disturbing that Albus genuinely thought that he had it bad when Harry grew up without parents or a life.

It's sad that's she has allowed her name to be plastered on the front of this book, because the writing style doesn't even come close to her own. It makes me wonder if she'd read the script, or only saw the production. The best was to summarize this explanation, is to compare it to ""Wicked"". We're all familiar with The Wizard of Oz, but no one ever thought what had happened there before Dorothy arrived. That's why the 'book' (not script) was popular (pun intended), & eventually written as a screenplay. This script is being touted as ""Book 8"". Sadly, that's not what it is at all. JK ruined the characters by allowing someone else to ""puppeteer"" her characters which she slowly allowed to grow and thrive. It's proof that a ""Book 9"" won't be written, because she'll have to clean up what was essentially a ghost writer did to her characters. The only way she'd be able to revive HP, would be to write a prequel. And that d need to be a direct prequel to The Harry Potter series. NOT Fantastic Beasts, which only links to Potter's world because he reads the book at Hogwarts. Book 8 has essentially ended Harry Potter for good. It's fantastic to be able to imagine the characters coming back to life in our heads, but sadly, I think this may have been ""money motivated"".",TRUE,children

So that makes me all the more disappointed in this play. While I understand that, as a play, it's meant to be performed, and some of the nuance might be lost in translation, the flaws are too dramatic to be excused like that. All our beloved characters, Harry, Hermione, Ron...they're all horribly out of character. And OTHER beloved characters (Neville, Luna, George, Teddy, to name a few) are completely missing. The plot is convoluted and overwrought, the big ""reveal"" is extremely obvious from very early on, and to be honest, the story is just...bad. I wanted this play to be the heart-wrenching tale of a son trying desperately to connect to a father that he can't understand, the story of a father who is trying to come to terms with both his horrible past and the fact that his son seems to be the very antithesis of him. I wanted this story to be HUMAN, even though it's set in a magical world. What I got was a story that is too caught up in its own magical setting to remember that a good story should ALWAYS be driven by the characters within it. If you're a Harry Potter fan, feel free to get this book to complete your Harry Potter shelf of books.

Because of that, I strongly believed that the writers of this play would not be allowed to take this beautiful universe that she created and pervert it. I was wrong. It read like fanfiction (bad fanfiction) and what was done to the characters that I grew up with is unforgivable. I'm shocked and disgusted that JK Rowling would put her name on this.

You'll read it in the other reviews, I'm sure, but the plot holes and characterization of this story were just horrendous. There is no other word for it. You might find yourself, as I did, occasionally swept along in the story, but that doesn't make it a good story. It certainly doesn't excuse the poor writing which is filled to the brim with trope after trope, cliche after cliche, corny phrase after corny phrase. That JK Rowling would lend her support to a script of such poor quality is inconceivable. Perhaps she was confunded? By page 42 I was ready to be done, by page 242 I was laughing hysterically. This script is pure tripe. I don't have a problem reading it in script form.

That's why he's ""wonky."" Most kids books are beautifully illustrated, but this one is unsettling. The content is definitely comical, but the illustrations are a dark mis-match.

I just fell for the hype. I have 2 copies of The Wonky Donkey and I won’t read either to any child. The only reason I would read them to an adult would be to show what not to teach children through books. Sure, it has a catchy little rhythm. I’ll give it that but, the entire book makes fun of the “imperfections” of the donkey. He has only 3 legs so, he is a wonky donkey. As the story goes on the donkey has more things that are less than perfect and in each case that is added to the rhyme. The problem is, when we read this book, or similar ones, to children we indicate to them that it is fine to make fun of the “imperfections” of others. We tell them, through our acceptance and sharing, that it’s just fine to refer to someone in a derogatory manner. It isn’t ok for children or adults to tease, bully, or taunt another and it isn’t ok to indicate to children that that behavior is acceptable. The thinking that it’s just a children’s book, doesn’t get it. Every time you read a book to a child, they learn and your reading it to them sends a message.",TRUE,children

Instead of finding his crayons, he finds a pack of letters. Going through each color individual, they all had something bad to say to the boy. One did not like how he colors out of the lines and the other as not fond of how much he was used. If the complaining was not bad enough, each complaint had its own, very wordy letter. Many kids could not follow along with all the pages and words. They quickly lost interest and this book was thankfully short lived. When I try to teach kids about coloring, I get them excited telling them there are no rules.

399255370,1.0,... it works day-after-day to bring so much color and joy into the lives of others,1.0,"I originally loved this book, but Daywalt is now banned from our house for being a sexist pig. [...] Have you ever wondered how a crayon feels as it works day-after-day to bring so much color and joy into the lives of others? Especially if you're one of the colors that seems to get much more use than the other colors ? *coughbluecough* Well, look no further than Drew Daywalt and Oliver Jeffer's delightful The Day the Crayons Quit. Daywalt introduces us to Duncan's box of crayons; a box that has had enough. The crayons are going on strike, and tell Duncan - through a series of hilariously honest letters - all the reasons why they can't work for him anymore. The idea of crayons going on strike is funny to begin with, but Daywalt manages to combine that humor with intelligence and charm, as the book looks into all the reasons why the crayons feel the way that they do. As we learn that the red crayon feels overworked, or that the white crayon feels underused, the book helps reinforce the idea of respecting one another, and also respecting the idea of sharing and of being equal in our day-to-day lives. Within all of those letters, there's also a positive lesson of the value of speaking your mind. Duncan manages to find a solution for the crayons that brings harmony and joy back into the crayon box, and back into Duncan's life. With delightful artwork from Oliver Jeffers - seriously, the way the letters were written + accompanying drawings made me crack up - this is a book has become a instant winner in my book. *** Bottom line: This is a book with not only a unique premise, but smart lessons, funny writing and charming drawings, which makes this a must-have for every shelf. I predict that Daywalt and Jeffers will cause generations of kids to look at their crayon boxes a little differently after reading this, and will have them wondering just what it is their crayons are thinking.",FALSE,children
399255370,1.0,Not for little kids,93.0,"This story looked cute enough, but as a mom, I pretty much disliked it. The premise is adorable: the crayons go on strike list their grudges and there's a happy ending. The pictures are pretty cute too and the artwork was well done and matched the text well. I had two big problems with it. The first is that the book just isn't really for kids. It's the kind of book that adults think is funny and will enjoy reading, but I don't think really appeals to kids. I was laughing, but my kids were both like, enough whiny crayons already, where's the story? So if you put it in the same category with Go the $%^ to Sleep, it's a winner. My kids 4.5 and 2.5 were just kind of bored. My big problem though is with the tongue-in-cheek page about pink being a ""girl's color."" I know, the book was trying to point out how silly and limiting that is. Bravo to the book for trying to change the minds of kids who think that. The thing is, my kids don't really think that yet. Maybe someday, they will, but I'd like for them to feel as though they have the whole rainbow to explore unencumbered for as long as possible. It's like books refuting the existence of Santa, or teaching about monsters under the bed. Fine, yes, someday they will pick that up at school and we'll deal with it then, but I'd rather not be the one to introduce the concept. We may love this book in a few years when my kids get the joke, and my daughter is languishing in a pink abyss, but by then I suspect they'll have outgrown picture books.",FALSE,children

399255370,1.0,Surprisingly sad read,56.0,Anita Klein Based on the rave reviews I thought this would be fantastic. Now I'm just really confused by all those good reviews??? The crayons basically dump their unhappy thoughts on this poor kid Duncan (using some pretty harsh words to do so) one crayon even criticizes his coloring abilities (staying within the lines). The entire book is page after page of negative letters written to this child. Finally at the end you get a full spread of a picture Duncan has colored in reponse to all the complaints. I'm assuming the point is to encourage creativity? That rainbows can be black etc. But if you look at the finished picture you see that Duncan has just pretty much drawn what was demanded of him by the crayons. Where is the creativity in that? Far to negative in my opinion to read to your kids ( especially for preschool and kindergarten). I'd say purchase The Dot by Peter H. Reynolds if you want to inspire your child to be creative.

399255370,1.0,"Boring, whiny, disturbing",54.0,"My book-loving, crayon-loving child got about one quarter of the way through this book and put it down, never to pick it up again. After several months, we donated it to our local library, though not without a twinge of guilt, given how horrible the book is. First, as others have noted, there's not much to hold the attention of young children. Some crayons write letters, and then a child draws a picture--that's the entire action of the book. Also, as other negative reviews have noted, the crayons are jerks and model bad behavior. They complain about too much drawing, the wrong kind of drawing, about things not being fair, about a young child drawing outside the lines--really? the book scolds children for coloring very slightly outside the lines???--and all of these are seemingly seen as compelling arguments since the young boy changes his behavior in response. Perhaps more disturbingly, the entire premise of the book seems to be recognizing that differently colored CRAYONS are all capable of a wide variety of things and should be free to explore their different talents and interests. The CRAYONS complain because their aspirations and abilities are being limited by the behavior of a young boy--not because he's an overt crayon-bigot, mind you, but just because he's oblivious to other possibilities. However, it's only the peach-colored crayon who worries about being naked, and even after the boy is chastised for only drawing things with the most traditional color scheme possible, he draws a supposedly super-creative picture that still only features people with white- and peach-colored skin. The entire book is encourages thinking beyond the default color in their representations, but the idea that the default color for humans is white-to-peach is never challenged and is at least arguably actually reinforced. The big crisis of color discrimination that this book addresses is that the boy doesn't recognize that he could draw an orange whale, but it never occurs to the boy (or the illustrator) that the rainbow of creative OR ACTUAL possibilities for human flesh tones moves beyond the white-to-peach spectrum. Ok, well, glad we tackled THAT crisis of representation and oblivious color discrimination, then!",FALSE,children

Purple complains about coloring outside the lines , the severity of his statements are cringe worthy from healthy relationship standpoint.

Gray whines about coloring elephants and other big animals and wishes for smaller details (nothing bothered me on this page). White says he doesn't show (exactly my thought when a 12 pack of colored pencils has white....) Black wants to color more but use the word ""hate"" which is a word I'd rather not use in literature for pre-readers (yes, my husband and I do use ""worse words"" in real life, occasionally but still). Green is happy but states yellow and orange are fighting over who should be the sun and aren't speaking. Orange and yellow both repeat they aren't on speaking terms the emphasis on not speaking is a lot and I question what that is teaching since I know many adults who are not on speaking terms due to toxic decisions within families to not address issues. Orange calls yellow ""the big whiner & tattletale"" so name calling and I question the negative association of tattletales when a goal of parents is to be the safe place for our children especially if they are being bullied (or worse). Blue can't see because he's so short from so much use. Pink doesn't get used because Duncan is a boy but she is happy his sister colored a princess and recommends being used as a dinosaur (gender stereotypes). Peach had its paper peeled and is naked (he mentions his nakedness 3 times), he asks if you'd want to go to school naked, but signing the letter your ""naked friend"" was a whole new level of cringe worthy.

125030170X,2.0,A Therapist's Opinion,1.0,"This book was promoted as a psychological thriller. The narrator is a psychotherapist who works in a forensic psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, the story is not accurate. In the United States, modern day psychiatric hospitals in the United State are licensed and monitored closely by The Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation, Medicare, Medicaid, and a host of other external agencies. I do not know about the laws in the United Kingdom but suspect they are similar. Mental illness should not be minimized or distorted to sell a book. Neither should the many excellent therapists and psychiatrics who treat people inpatient and outpatient be misrepresented in such a unkind manner. This is troubling. Some of the lay public will believe that this type of treatment happens on a daily basis. The narrator described himself as someone who is troubled using an obscene word. There is a vetting process to weed out unhealthy people entering the helping profession to fix themselves. Trust is a key issue between the patient and therapist. In this story was the patient betrayed by many people including her psychiatrist, therapist, husband, father, aunt and art gallery dealer. The plot could have been reworked with another person producing conflict. We have an obligation as a writers to do background and research. This story may have been entertaining to be on the best seller list but accuracy was poor. Hollywood and the publishing industry tend to portray psychotherapy in an unfriendly light. In comparison, the Steven White and Jonathan Kellerman, with healthy hero's, while providing best sellers. Also, they portray mental health in a compassionate format, yet still capture the reader, providing a suspenseful story. Read the Making of a Psychiatrist by David Viscott - a true story. I wonder if the writer interviewed any psychiatrists or therapists for deep background. There is a code - Do No Harm - that mental health professionals are expected to abide by. There are ethical standards that are required. Psychiatrists and therapists must be licensed. In summary, I hope this lay public sees this story as fictional, and the writer has chosen to follow a route that does not represent modern day psychotherapy.

The author writes both characters in his voice so you know you're reading what the author wants to say not the character. It would have worked better if the diary sections were just flashbacks without the diary gimmick. (I had a fleeting hope the diary entries were faked by another character, thus the similar voice, but, alas, it's just poor writing.) This style story is all about the twist. I find myself wanted to keep going to the next chapter, not because I was enjoying the ride, but because I knew the only this that counted was how it ended. I'm not going to say I predicted the ending, but I saw it was going to be an unreliable narrator. There were just too many dangling thoughts that characters had that we, the reader didn't hear. Honestly, there were enough evidence to point to a number of possible endings. It's like the movie Clue where finding out any one of the characters did it would not be a surprise.

Who on earth writes a diary loaded with character descriptions and stretches of dialogue worthy of, well, a mystery novel?

125030170X,2.0,"An Over-Hyped, Mediocre Disappointment",6.0,"I love a good mystery or thriller that not only tells a page-turning story but that examines human psychology while it tells that story. When this is done right, character, setting and action come together and reveal some of the mystery of our condition, either through identification or voyeurism or a combination of both. Unreliable narrators, hidden clues, twists and cliff-hangers are literary devices used to support the reader's identification, not as an end in themselves. I fell victim to the hype of The Silent Patient and bought it because of the promised ""twist"" and hoping for the type of psychological thriller that revealed human nature as the best mysteries and thrillers and indeed crimes do. The Silent Patient disappoints on every conceivable measure of a good read. I don't mind a pot boiler either, but even the pulp writers of yore generally gave good character, plot and setting. Not always, but often, in addition to the plot and characters, readers learn about a profession or hobby or region or other field of specialization because the characters and the plot are enmeshed in that specialization. In The Silent Patient, the setting of a mental hospital and the profession of psychotherapy are the things the reader should be learning about as they read, but the knowledge given is very shallow. The writing is competent and forgettable and goes down smoothly enough and is my reason for giving two stars rather than one. The characters are two dimensional and I couldn't connect with or understand any of their motives; even when those motives were finally revealed they didn't make sense or seem to be connected to human behavior even if the humans in question were traumatized or mentally ill. Flat cardboard cut-outs doing ridiculous things in service of the promised ""twist"" is as good as it gets. And then there is the promised ""twist"" which isn't nearly as surprising as other reviewers seem to think, especially if the reader is experienced in the genre of mysteries and thrillers. Readers might not see the ending coming but it isn't because the writer has slowly revealed the thoughts and emotions of the characters and the details of the crime but rather because neither the twist nor the ending make a lot of sense. The book ends abruptly because examining the nonsensical aspects of plot, character and setting by the reader can't be sustained if the book wants to retain buzz. As psychological thrillers go, especially of the English tradition, this book falls miserably short. It is pretty clear that the twist was conceived first and the plot and characters written in service of hooking the reader or rather the buyer. My recommendation? Save your money until the paperback is released or the kindle price drops, or better yet, skip this disappointing marketing project masquerading as a psychological thriller. I suggest reading A Fatal Inversion by Barbara Vine instead. That book really does have a twist that the reader doesn't see coming and the plotting and psychology are believable too.",FALSE,children

Well, I no longer trust reviewers that climax on books ending up being disappointments. See, I have been burned and, frankly, I am tired of the hype circus. But I have been had again. Much hype has made about The Silent Patient, a ridiculous novel acclaimed by The New York Times, where it became an “instant number one bestseller.” Brad Pitt’s production company has optioned it. (Possibly, with a good scriptwriter given to rational thinking and serious editing, the picture could be an improvement from the novel.) I am relieved to find out that Kirkus Reviews was not part of the marketing propaganda, calling the mystery “amateurish, with a twist savvy readers will see coming from a mile away.” The Silent Patient has quite a few twists, in fact, starting from intriguing and developing into dumb and dumber. The concept itself is seductive. I mean, speaking of dumb, I was caught. A psychotherapist wants to break the silence of a patient accused of murdering her husband, and through the exploring of her mind manage to solve the mystery. The minimalistic prose and short chapters with dramatic or cryptic endings are also appealing, both for readers who like a page-turner, and for the ones who hope that this will be intelligent, redolent, atmospheric, Hitchcockian. Alas, alas! What we have instead is a mystery with clues planted like artificial flowers, pretending to belong, but cheapening a tale that at first sounded promising. A seven-year-old could improvise a similar, disconnected tale. While a lot of action happens in a mental institution and thus among experts of the human psyche, the story fills out with little character development. Superficial, it flows like a soap opera and ends with a grand guignol coup de theatre. If I were asked, to the one who is just curious about Michaelides’s first novel, I’d say: No prob. It’s a fast read, you won’t waste too much of your time, and your grey cells will neither overwork nor will you catch a headache. To the major critics who keep applauding rubbish, I may ask a couple of questions: Are you trying to kill literature? Who is going to give it a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if you keep going? To myself I’d mumble: Shut up and go back to your classics! Read once more The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, which has a similar approach to The Silent Patient’s.

125030170X,2.0,Assault by cliches,185.0,"I'm pretty disappointed in The Silent Patient. Not because it's not very good -- and I don't think it's very good -- but because so many reviews are so exuberant, and so much buzz and attention surround it. It really worries me about the state of public taste and an understanding of quality. So, without being too snarky ... it was painful to get through this. Every scene, character and almost every sentence is a cliche. It's a very flat story in that it's all shown from the perspective of what the protagonist(s) see at the moment; there's no subtext, no resonance to anything other than the one dimensional present. My guess is Mr. Michaelides wrote this as a screenplay then decided to novelize it. The ""snappy"" jumps from one ironic comment to the next scene shriek of cinematography, and while there's nothing wrong with that, a novel should have some depth beyond the immediate surface. Every timeworn scene is in there -- the scary old house with the mysterious stranger at the window; people jumping at you from the dark for a ""boo"" moment; the kindly old professor who seems to have every musical instrument stuffed into his office, including, yes, a harp; the loose floorboard in which a secret clue is hidden (how many loose floorboards do you have in your house?). Mr. Michaelides also seems to like the word ""bitch"" a lot, which is kind of disturbing -- he has a lot of the characters describe women this way, and it's unpleasant. He also has only one description for most men, which is ""well-built."" But it's the cliched writing that's really hard to slog through; some examples (no spoilers, I hope): ""If looks could kill, I would have dropped dead;"" ""She devoured his kisses hungrily;"" ""A chorus of bells started ringing in my head, clanging, chiming, reverberating."" Oh my! Another problem I had is motivation. In a convincing story, people do things based on human reactions and emotions, and no matter the subject, if we as readers identify with the motivations, it's all the more engaging. Mr. Michaelides lays out his characters and their motivations in a sort of legalistic way, i.e., all the evidence and facts are there, but it's as though he's never met a real human before and is jotting down their behavior as if from a textbook. It's hard to identify with any of the cliche'd characters because they operate so far from human reality. Now, I wouldn't be this critical if this was some run-of-the-mill mystery. But the magnitude of the praise seems totally at odds with the quality of the work. I only finished it because I paid $18 and wanted the payoff. And there is one. It's a TWIST, but it's sort of like twist #6, and you can see it coming about a mile off. So I was disappointed -- not so much with Mr. Michaelides, who presents a solid if uninspired product -- but with the clamor of critics and reviewers who tell us this is something great. Also note -- A.J. Finn, whose name and praise are all over this book has been revealed as a liar and somewhat of a scam artist. I would guess a good number of the great reviews you are seeing are paid and/or manipulated. Finn is not good company to be in right now, and if I were you, I would give careful critical eye to the praise here. Something's not right.",TRUE,children

His final action defies logic. And then there is the silent patient who has been ostensibly traumatized, not spoken for many many years, and has been heavily drugged on and off during that time. And yet, when she finally does speak, she becomes completely lucid in a matter of days and has the presence of mind to formulate a rational approach to her situation.

125030170X,2.0,Likely the Last Psychological Thriller I'll Read,,"This book is really well written and a very fast read. I read it with a few other people and we all of finished it within a couple days. It was both engaging and interesting with a kind of fly-on-the-wall feel to the narration. The main character, Theo, feels very real and is a fascinating character just on his own. The author is great at weaving strong details throughout the story and creating readable characters. It felt like stepping into the world of the book and it was easy to become enveloped in the world. So why did I give it only two stars? Because it suffers from the same problem that many similar psychological thrillers: the undeserved twist. Maybe this is mostly personal since I'm starting to see it as a pattern in this genre. That's the biggest reason this is two stars instead of one. I'll avoid spoilers since I do think it's a well-written book and I think that a lot of people would genuinely still enjoy it. An undeserved twist is when the reader could never possibly see it coming. To many people, that sounds like praise, but it is not. Because it's not that the reader DIDN'T see it coming it's that they COULDN'T. The reader doesn't have the necessary information to figure out what's going on before the author reveals it. This has always bothered me because it tells me the author doesn't trust their readers. I could go on about this topic but I'll keep it short here. (I have a full blog post about it when I read Watching You by Lisa Jewell if you want to hear more of my thoughts.) I do not appreciate when authors don't trust the reader. I think Michaelides is a competent and skilled author who could definitely put in the proper details without giving away the ending to very many.

125030170X,2.0,Unsatisfying,1.0,"The feeling I had when finishing this book was disappointment. It started out well. The descriptions were good and we are meant to like the main character, Theo, a trained therapist. He lands on the scene for his new job at the mental hospital and all but demands an entirely different course of treatment for a patient he has met maybe one time; he is arguing with experienced caregivers whose own treatment plan is not working, but they somehow go along with him. Even though he is way younger and not as experienced and has not even worked with the patient. This is flat out unrealistic. Strike one. He quickly becomes insecure, whining, and pitiful. Strike two. By this point, I was invested and had to continue reading to find out how it all turned out. The most egregious error the author makes is with the timing and details, particularly towards the end. This makes it appear that he was suddenly in a hurry to finish the book. Supposedly Alicia didn't know who Theo was when they first met, however, it turns out that she did indeed recognize him. Huh? Next, we have Theo madly in love with his wife and supposedly getting along with her pretty well at the start of the book, but wait, she stepped out on him prior to all of that and became distant, fat, and uninterested. Which was it? The way the author attempted to tie up all of the loose ends at the conclusion of the book was sloppy and actually impossible if you followed the timeline the author, himself, set out. Strike three, you're out. Some of the writing was good, but the result was a let down.",FALSE,children
125030170X,2.0,Good if you like Freud and editing inconsistencies,,"Before I begin with the review, I want to say I REALLY struggled on what to rate this. I am giving it a two over one because this book has a few redeeming qualities. One of them is the plot. Although it is not a fast-paced, gripping plot that leaves you turning pages, there were times when I did enjoy it. It was written in a way that made me want to figure out what exactly happened and why it happened. The ending was completely unexpected. I was prepared to be disappointed by the ending because I had a few theories about what might happen, but, wow, never in a hundred years’ would I have guessed it. The last few hundred pages or so were thoroughly enjoyable, plot-wise. But that is the extent of the pros. The last few hundred pages were thoroughly enjoyable, PLOT-wise. This book is not well written. It was suggested on a list for those who had enjoyed Gone Girl. I did not expect the writing to be up to Flynn’s level, but it honestly shocked me how extremely poorly written this was. The narrator is boring, unlikeable, and uneasy to sympathize with. I started this book a few times before finishing it because the first hundred pages so move absurdly slowly. It is very hard to get into. Besides the writing, there are editing and spelling/grammatical inconsistencies; at one point, the narrator, speaking about his wife, mentions she is American, “not only in the way she looks and speaks” but other aspects as well. Not even a hundred pages later, he mentions her prepping for a play by “doing an American accent for six weeks”, indicating that actually, she is British, like him. I am honestly astounded the editors didn’t notice this. There are also errors in spelling such as: “Alicia eyes lowered”, with other similar ones. This, along with the writing, makes it very hard to get through this book. I really wonder how the editor did such a poor job. Overall, I would not recommend this book to fans of thrillers such as Gone Girl. The twist is good, but that’s truly about it. The writing is really just terrible, it’s difficult to get through, and the editing overlooks multiple inconsistencies. Also, it’s almost comical how the author writes patients in the psychiatric ward, such as Elif. It is simply not how psychiatric hospitals/patients work. Besides this, the near-constant Freud references are just irritating and make the book seem outdated.",TRUE,children

This is clearly an individual complaint, because others rave about it, but whilst the clinical case was interesting, the execution never quite clicked with me. I found the diary entries fairly pointless until the very end; the vast majority of them simply didn't add anything of value go the novel for me. The problem is that I didn't find Theo's perspective riveting either. I never found myself caring about any of the characters, except perhaps the clinical lead who has precious little screen time. It doesnt help that whilst the personal scenes from Theo's perspective are eventually relevant, I spent my time bored by them. They didn't increase my interest in this character, somehow they did the opposite. Either way, this is a subject matter that would normally have me hooked and it failed to do so at any point. Even at the big reveal, I was left wondering if that was it. Don't take my word for it, mind. Most people seem to have loved this so I am definitely in the minority.

And he was right, of course, the prose and writing is very standard and basic, and, if not for the occasional curse word, could be a young adult novel. With no real suspense or atmosphere and such a simple idea, I was just left scratching my head. While reading the book, I kept waiting for something to happen, and then, at nearly the very end, when it did, I sighed and shook my head. Really? I asked myself. This was the big surprise?

125030170X,2.0,Not Well Written,17.0,"This is a read that I was thrilled about. It’s everywhere- on Tiktok, on Instagram, on Facebook- everyone talks about their recent reads and this book always seems to be in that list. I’ve heard glowing reviews, excitement to read it, and hype up to the max degree. Which is why my review is a dismal 2/5 stars, as it didn’t live up to the hype, and in fact, it horrifies me that so many people enjoyed this novel. At first, I found myself perplexed by the tone of the novel. It felt less like I was reading a mental health professional, and more like I was reading an old detective novel. What should have been a read that sucked me in and went quickly, was instead painfully slow. I felt the book crawling, and found the writing to be dry, rife with short statement sentences that made the music of the book tonally flat. I haven’t read anything else by Alex Michaelides- though The Maidens is in my TBR list- and I don’t know if this is the author’s voice, or if it’s just this particular novel’s tone, but it was thoroughly unenjoyable and I found myself waiting for it to pick up. Finally, it did- at least I thought so. We got into more character development, more from Alicia’s perspective, but… this is where I found the most fault. The formatting of this novel is downright bizarre: Each part resets the count of the chapters, which was aggravating to say the least. That is a method I’ve seen used in non-fiction but never in fiction, and I found myself irritated. Not only that, but throughout the novel are Alicia’s “diary entries”, bits of story told from her perspective. But this pissed me off! They are titled diary entries, and she even explains she’s writing down her thoughts: But they’re written like scenes. Many of them contain full back and forth dialogue, with perfect recollection. I would have rather seen them just as they were: Alicia’s point of view scenes. Having them be “diary entries” was angering, because they weren’t. Diary entries, when written by a character, are not written in this way. I found it distracting, taking me out of the book and unable to connect with Alicia. The wonky formatting did nothing but lower my opinion of this book, and make it impossible to relax into the novel. As the book went on, I became increasingly aware of two more things I despised: The way mental health is handled, for one, and sexual commentary through Alicia’s point of view, for another. On the first point, this is a book steeped in mental health, with most of the cast of characters being therapists or doctors- or having mental health issues. Some areas are done well, but some are done so horribly that it makes me shudder to think of people reading this book and taking this portrayal as fact. The opinion of main character Theo regarding the patients at The Grove can sometimes be not only ignorant, but offensive. I think a lot of the mental health related moments in this book are poorly researched, or just poorly presented. As for my second point: Moments where Alicia described her husband, and her feelings for him, were often cringeworthy to read. She was written with this idolization of him, this passionate desire for him in perfectly normal, everyday situations. It was as if reading one of those internet memes about “men writing women”. I think it was unappealing, poorly done, and bordering on unrealistic. I found myself wondering why the abrupt sexual commentary was in this book at all- because it popped up more than once. The one decent thing I can say about this story is that it has all the beats of a good story- even if they’re poorly done. There are decent bits of character descriptions when they get introduced, the story idea is solid, and there were some parts that weren’t so bad. But the way this story is told was horrendous. Shifting timelines lead to a really big payoff to the mystery- but only if you don’t figure it out before you get there, and unfortunately, there were some fairly big tells for the end if you are an experienced reader of thrillers, or if you were paying enough attention. Not only that, but there are some storylines that go unanswered, and they feel like they were just there to distract and trick. I felt like the end reveal was the focus and everything that led up to it was just meant to be a distraction, instead of a real part of the story. It was annoying to see all these ideas go nowhere. Most of all, the thing that infuriated me the most was that the entire book is about one simple question. Why is Alicia silent- why doesn’t she talk? Only, the answer to this is not a good one. It’s deeply metaphoric, surrounded by a Greek myth, full of intrigue- but the payoff is so poor, and it leaves a lot to be desired. The most important aspect of this book, and it’s utterly disappointing. Overall, this book is probably a 3/5. But I chose to give it a 2/5 because of my struggle to get through it, and my disappointment in comparison to the hype. I regret wasting my time reading it. I write about mental health all the time- so to see this book, a poor excuse for representation, get so much undeserved hype makes me all the more upset. This is a slow, agonizing read that made me grit my teeth, and I hope those who read it are not easily fooled by the tricks that cover up what is an amazing plot turned into mush by poor writing.",TRUE,children

Ever heard the old joke about therapists all being really f***** up? Tired, desperate clichés like these are strewn about very carelessly in this book. The protagonist is not very smart. From the beginning, he decides to leave a job for an establishment that might soon close. That, Mr author, is kind of a red flag, that something is very wrong with this guy. In a clinical setting, the motives behind his keen interest in this patient would have been questioned more effectively and I doubt that so many lines would have been crossed as to blur the lines between patient/therapist. His obssession would have been thwarted in it's infancy. I also noted that the therapist does not engage in caring for other patients at all. He only addresses other patients when he needs information about his own patient which is incredibly rude. The message he is sending other patients is this : I don't care about your wellfare I only just want to hear about her. What a remarkably light caseload this therapist has! Just the one patient. That's it. It's not a bad book. But due to such incongruencies the big plot twist isn't so shocking as it could have been.

So, much of the early part of the book is interesting and well done. But then it collapses in such a confusing way that it makes you give up on the whole thing. Forget the reviews that hype the “wonderful” twist. It isn’t wonderful in the slightest. It is a badly contrived and totally unbelievable “twist” that undermines any interest you had in the protagonist, not the patient, and thereby undo any interest you may have had in the build-up. Picture this: You’re in the audience of what has been billed as a marvelous performance by a marvelous magician. And, indeed, his build-up for a “sensational” bit of magic is intriguing. Then he tells you he will make his unusual pet, a duck-billed platypus, just disappear. Wow! Captivating! But then you watch him go to a blocked-off part of the stage, open a trap door and push his pet into the hole. Then he waves his magic wand. The end.

There is a shroud of mystery around the deed and the criminal psychotherapist Theo wants to uncover those answers. So he takes a job at the hospital she is imprisoned in and starts to weed his way into her mind. There were many great scene of dialogue between Theo and Alicia but little character development. The pace was slow at the start of the book and quickened toward the end, finishing a little too abruptly. It wasn’t as suspenseful as most thrillers nor was it engaging. I would find myself putting the book down and doing other things. I usually finish a thriller in one full sitting. This one I just couldn’t get into. I didn’t get that palpitating heartbeat turning each page for answers. 30 pages in I knew what happened. Unfortunately, there was no big mystery for me.

That's what keeps happening right up until page 170 or 180, after which there's a small twist (which I'll admit made me go, ""Oh, ok.""). But still that's no excuse for zero character development for any of the characters, especially the main ones. Some sections seem to have been written in a hurry or just abandoned. Maybe the author was up against a deadline or he realized it wasn't going anywhere.

Should I take the time to rage write this review? Probably not, but I am RILED, and my husband listened to my rant and said ""uhm I'm sorry?"" So obviously he has never experienced this level of betrayal by mystery novel. I hope for his sake he never does. This book came out sometime last year and I decided not to read it because I had somehow gotten it confused with the plot of another book. I thought this book was about a child in a coma, and I immediately thought, ""yeah, mother of two over here! No thank you! I can't deal with that level of intensity taking over my reading hobby."" Well, if you thought this book was about a child in a coma let me set the record straight. IT IS NOT. This book started catching hype and I stumbled across a review that said this book was about a woman who snapped and shot her husband in the face 5 times and then refused to talk ever again. SOLD. I WAS SOLD. This is somehow intensity that I am fine incorporating into my reading hobby. I'm not going to explore that further and neither should you. The Silent patient is in fact about a woman who snaps, shoots her husband 5 times and then refuses to talk ever again, but it is also about a psychotherapist named Theo, who over identifies with her story and really wants to help her. In a very dramatic plot twist towards the end of the book I discovered that this book is also about HOW AN AUTHOR SHOULD NOT WRITE A THRILLER/MYSTERY NOVEL. Listen Alex, (I'm not even going to ask him if I can use his first name because he didn't earn the honor of my using his last name so respectfully 💅💅💅) it's too late to mop up this mess, but if you plan on pulling these same shenanigans in a future ""mystery novel"" I'm going to need you to R.E.S.P.E.C.T your readers a little bit. Here's the thing, mystery novels ARE MY JAM. I love unreliable narrators, I love thinking everyone is a suspect, and I love a good plot twist. This book had a good plot twist. It was so shocking I GASPED in the bathtub, and then I turned the page to keep reading, and that was when the RAGE took hold. Do you want to know the difference between a good suspense/mystery and a bad one? It isn't how believable the twist is. It isn't even how the book wraps everything up. It is in the tiny minute clues and details that tried to warn you about the plot twist. The very best twist will shock you, but also have you screaming ""oh my gosh of course! How did I not see that coming!?"". This book did none of that and to me that is an inexcusable offense in this genre. You don't get to pull this out of your butt and say ""hahahaha GOTCHA."" You have to work for the 'gotcha.' The only ground work the author put down happened 4 pages before the reveal and it was not groundwork, it was a rickety-ladder-over-an-open-canyon-of-doom. I'd give this book somewhere between 2.5-3 stars because it is engrossing. I did that ""oh I'll just read a chapter while my kids play at the library"" thing and then I binged the book in two days, but I'm disappointed in the way this went down.

I finished the book wondering how it got as many good reviews as it did. Did everyone read another story? The premise was promising; a woman artist with a tragic past murders her handsome, successful husband and then refuses to speak a word about what happened. She is tried and sent to a mental institution where she spends years in her silent prison. She’s heavily medicated, but no other efforts seem to be made to reach her on a basic level. Enter psychotherapist Theo who has been obsessed with this case for years and finally manages to get hired at the facility housing the artist. The entire staff seems to agree that she is untreatable, yet newbie Theo is granted permission to work with her as a therapist. The head of the unit even convinces her psychiatrist to reduce her medication levels drastically and immediately, with no weaning from the heavy tranquilizers. Theo is not only able to get her to speak a few words to him, but the following day she hands him her diary dating from the time before the murder. Where this has been for the past six years and how Alicia managed to keep it in her hands throughout her imprisonment and commitment without any seeing it or reading it is a mystery. Theo reads the diary and gives it back to Alicia. He tells his supervisor about the contents of the diary but provides no evidence to back his story up, and no one appears to feel it’s important to get the book from Alicia. Theo begins investigating Alicia’s life, interviewing her cousin, brother-in-law, and gallery owner, asking questions that are completely taboo for a psychiatric professional. The story gets rather confusing from this point, with Theo becoming more obsessed with Alicia while his marriage is falling apart and his behavior becomes more unconventional and borders on the illegal. Apparently, all this confusion is meant to cover up the final explosive plot twist that finally shows us what Theo’s interest in Alicia has been all along.

Unfortunately it turned out to be a big disappointment. It has one thing going for it: a really good plot twist near the end. It's a very clever idea, even if the explanation behind it is far-fetched, and was a complete surprise to me. If only the rest of the novel had been up to the same standard... The author has clearly done plenty of research on psychology and psychotherapy; there are frequent stodgy lumps of regurgitated theory throughout. The writing itself is poor and prone to clichés, the hurried pace allows for no detail or reflection and the characterisation is weak and unconvincing. It's set in London but the language and dialogue often feel like they were written by an American or at least someone who has spent much time in America (I'm not sure of the author's nationality). The symbolism used is painfully unsubtle and the attempts to create tension generally fall flat. There are also a number of plot holes and unexplained threads left dangling at the end.

This works when the character's thought process and mannerisms stay the same. You get that moment when you realize you misjudged the character all along. That this character is not who you thought they were. This book fails to provide the ah-ha moment because the writer changes the character's thought process. This is not clever. This is not even slightly artful because anyone can do this. Elementary school writing. Anyone can change a character's mind and thoughts to reveal evil intentions.

I also feel like all the women in this book were portrayed to be weak and nothing they do was appreciated. The only interesting parts for me were reading Alicia’s diary and the chapter where the “twist” happened. I must admit before the supposed twist, I figured where it was headed and ended up being right. Nonetheless, that chapter was interesting. At the same time, that’s when I noticed the book was told in a dual timeline which you would have never guess. It was confusing. The story has a great plot, I must give it that.

But, I found out pretty quickly, that the hype was just hype and this book was pretty shallow. I really didn't care for any of the characters. They all seemed shallow and more like cardboard cutouts to me than real people of many layers and much depth. And the plot. Suffice to say it was outlandish. I don't really mind an outlandish plot if the writing's good and the payoff is worth it. In this case, however, the writing was about one notch below adequate, and the payoff, the big twist a lot of people say they never saw coming, was easily telegraphed to the reader in the first third of the book. By then, an astute reader pretty much knows how this book is going to end. Now, even though I love mysteries, and they make up about ninety percent or more of my fiction reading material, I usually can't guess the ending. In this case, however, I had no problem at all. I really can't give you any examples as to why, because if I did, I'd be giving you a spoiler, and whereas I don't mind spoilers, I know a lot of you do. So, you won't find any here. I can tell you, without spoiling the plot at all, that the book is inconsistent. In one section, the analyst, Theo, is told he can't have a cigarette lighter in the hospital because one of the patients could get hold of it and start a fire. Yet later, one of the patients is smoking and Theo does, indeed, have a lighter. There are several such inconsistencies in the book, so I think it needed a good editing. I might be able to overlook such things, though no reader should have to, if the story is compelling enough, but such is not the case with this book. Maybe this just isn't the author for me. I don't know. I certainly didn't like the short, choppy chapters and very plain prose, but some people might love those things. As I said before, I can overlook things like that if the story is a good one. This just wasn't. I don't think I'll be buying the author's second book.

Yes, the prose is stilted and often poorly written but that could be overlooked. The idea that poor parenting causes not only severe mental illness, but specific types of mental illness is beyond outdated. I know wonderful parents who have had to deal with a child with mental illness, just as there are likely terrible parents who have relatively well adjusted children. Every page describes, in excruciating detail, the parental wrongs that have created the damaged adult protagonists. No character is remotely sympathetic.

The Silent Patient was one of the big bestsellers of 2019, and I was starting to feel like the only thriller reader left in the world not to have read it. I bought it on special ages ago and have been meaning to find out what all the fuss was about ever since. I won’t say I regret finishing it - I needed to know what The Big Twist was, it was a fast easy read on a cold grey day with nowhere else I needed to be, but I got to the end feeling let down and dissatisfied. With 94 994 reviews already on GoodReads, I don’t need to summarise the plot. There are over a million star ratings, the majority 4 and 5 stars, so clearly lots of people loved this. I guessed the twist about half way through and kept hoping I’d be wrong. Looking at a sample of the negative reviews, they are mostly from people with experience of working in mental health. I had concluded that the author must know nothing about modern psychiatry, so was gobsmacked to discover that he trained as a psychotherapist and spent two years working in a secure unit. To me the whole idea that a specialist unit on the verge of being shut down would employ a non-medically qualified psychotherapist who then proceeds to float about only treating one patient - that he clearly has an unhealthy obsession with - was ludicrous. None of the staff seem to notice that he’s constantly disappearing off to play detective and doesn’t actually do any work. The casual way the staff treat (using both the loosest and medical senses of that word) the patients was actually disgusting. I can see that a lay person could disregard all of this, and enjoy it as a compulsive suspense story, especially if you read it without being constantly on the lookout for The Twist, and don’t mind a hefty dose of writerly sneakiness. I’m not a literary snob and thought the writing was fine, but was bothered by the protagonist’s misogyny - only beautiful or maternal type women are worthy of his interest - and he really doesn’t like overweight people. The central mystery - why won’t Alicia speak? -wasn’t satisfactorily explained and lots of other threads were left hanging. I see that the author is a screenwriter and that this has been optioned as a movie - I actually think I would’ve enjoyed this more without Theo’s distasteful internal monologue and in the right hands this could make a great film. 2.5 rounded down for complete implausibility.",FALSE,children

Also, the mental hospital bears no resemblance to the way a real one is operated and what the roles are of the doctors, nurses, and administrators who work there.

Several times, Alicia is referred to as “a bitch” by doctors—I cannot imagine why the author chose to depict them as so blatantly unprofessional and adolescent. It’s quite disgraceful to the profession. I stuck this book out, entirely because our book club chose it for the month. The more I read, the stupider I thought it was. I actually feel cheated for having spent full price on it. The conversations between people are poorly scripted, juvenile and unrelated to the storyline. The trite little sex scenes—-like a cheap trashy paperback. I’ve never rolled my eyes more than I did with this book. Every time the main character Theo says anything, he sounds like a teenager with a first crush. The famous plot twist at the end is deflating, at best. Predictable and ridiculous. The whole diary thing reminds me of a high school essay, covered in red ink reprimands from the teacher, having been given a barely passable grade of D+. Unbearable. I’ve always known that movies that get overhyped are usually way below par. This book is a perfect example of some great marketing through decent testimonials, but in the end, lacking any substance.

The entire book consists of the protagonist explaining his motivations for reaching out and attempting to save the patient only to reveal in the final few pages that the protagonist himself is the one who put her in that condition. It is a sham technique.The narrative unfolds, interspersed by the protagonist's embarrassing monologues, as twin tales of his ostensibly selfless efforts to reach the patient, and of the steady erosion of his marriage. Only at the end do we discover these narrative threads are not running concurrently, but ran six years apart. This is where the fraud is perpetrated.

It made me cringe. It sounded like alot of geuss work and a really poor attempt to sound like he knew what he was talking about.

125030170X,1.0,A Penn and Teller trick described by Dan Brown. It was dark and stormy night.,32,"I have to say I didn’t see the TWIST at the end of this book coming. The whole book is an exercise in temporal misdirection and in my case it succeeded. That piece of conjuring skill aside, it is pretty awful. In fact, the TWIST is everything, the whole book is like a magic trick, everything else is just flummery, designed to distract the reader. I’ve just finished it, and as I start to digest what I’ve read, it makes less and less sense. I’m not sure that the central character’s motives have any credibility. The whole book is a contrivance, simply there to underpin the TWIST. So, everything is subservient to the TWIST, but that isn’t my only problem with this book. Number one, the writing is just so dull and unoriginal. Cliche follows cliche as sentences thud lifelessly across the page. As an illustration, here is the first paragraph of chapter 4. “I arrived at the Grove pursued by an icy January wind. The bare trees stood like skeletons along the road. The sky was white, heavy with snow that had yet to fall.” I have not picked out a particular low point, the entire book is written in a similar style. Even Snoopy, lying on the roof of his kennel, would be embarrassed. Number two, this is not an exercise in show don’t tell storytelling. This is show, tell and then bash on the thumb with hammer, just in case the reader missed it. As a case in point, some way into the book, we are introduced to Barbie an American who has had plastic surgery. Immediately after describing her, author Michaelides wields the hammer with “Her name suited her, she looked like a startledBarbie doll.” Now the book, may be an accurate and reliable description of psychotherapy, but I rather doubt it. It reads more like the Ladybird book of psychotherapy, written by someone who has been watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s nest. There is even a thinly disguised Nurse Ratchett on hand. The book could be described as a page turner, but the main reason for that is that every short chapter ends with a little hook to pull the reader into the next. It is manipulative, obvious, and repetitively tiring. The novel also feels like it was put together in the Harland and Wolf Shipyard. Each alternative, Agatha Christie style, suspect is swung into place by crane and riveted down. I freely admit that I thought I was watching a ship being put together, when in fact it was a Penn and Teller stage prop, but that doesn’t make the storytelling any more engaging. I honestly only finished this because it was selected by my book club, but really this deserves to be mentioned in the Dan Brown school of poor writing.",TRUE,children

Most of this book is a throw away because it drags and is not written with any of the suspense that is needed to carry a story that is so back heavy. The real story begins and ends in the last 62 pages, so really this might have been more effective as a novella or even a short story, hey it read like a screenplay really. I was thinking about 30 pages in that it would make a great lifetime movie. This definitely was not worth the read, it is a very vague domestic thriller that never really starts until the end.

He tells us that he has internalized his abusive father; but that hardly explains the bad judgements he makes in both his personal and professional life. He is obsessed by a beautiful catatonic mental health patient who was found guilty of killing her husband, and dedicates himself to getting her to talk. The language and characterizations are clichéd, and I did not find Theo believable, interesting, or worthy of empathy. As a reader I expect to care about the outcome of a book; and if it's billed as a psychological thriller, to feel some suspense, and ideally some triumph of good over evil, or perhaps some deeper understanding of the complexity of human nature.

125030170X,1.0,"If you made it part way and are wondering if you should finish - the answer is: no, don't bother",32,"So the premise is that a male psychologist becomes obsessed with a woman who was convicted of murdering her husband and is situated in a hospital for the criminally insane. The psychologist stalks the patient, going so far as to quit his job and apply for a position at the hospital where the woman is currently housed, lying in his job interview to disguise his obsession with her. He immediately formulates ways to get her alone with him under the guise of treatment. She's heavily medicated, incarcerated and has not uttered a word in 6+ years, making her the 'perfect woman' fantasy of every predatory man around her, including the main character, plus her personal ""one on one"" hospital orderly who thinks they have a special relationship, her psychiatrist who gives her enough medication to stun a horse, and the head psychiatrist who runs the institution where she's housed and also spoke at her murder trial in order to get her into his psych hospital. The female characters (if they are under 40 and described as someone's wife/partner) are all hyper-sexualized and all have sexual storylines in which they're always 'up for it' and propositioning men and betraying men sexually and speaking sexually and being ultra sexually beautiful (even if drugged to incapacitation, the male characters still have to assess their attractiveness) and there's pretty much an eye-rolling cliche per page in every chapter. Other than that the female characters have no discernible personality or voice. The male characters are equally two dimensional besides being predatory and a bit dimwitted, winking and nudging each other (rhetorically) as they talk about swooping in to save the more attractive of the mentally ill patients. It's like that. The author tries to tie in a childhood abuse story line when he wants to make a character more sympathetic, but he didn't do enough (any?) research to flesh that out and so it sounds like a 10th grader who got abuse stereotypes from TV shows. The writing itself is nothing special. Besides the continuous cliches and lack of story flow or character development, the words on the page don't attract any real notice, good or bad. It's a quick if joyless and unstimulating read. The twist at the end is totally not a twist. If you've made it part way through the book and are reading the 1-star reviews to see if anyone else agrees with you, we do. It's as disappointing as you think it is. And the end doesn't save it (the opposite) so just read some of the spoilers to satisfy your curiosity and then pat yourself on the back for not wasting more time on it. Final note: why do lame books get published so often? Because we believe the hype and buy them, so they keep churning out books like this from authors like this? I really think we can do better. Get the next hyped book from the library or *somewhere else that likes to pass around electronic books* and only reward the authors who are capable of good writing with your $$.

125030170X,1.0,Haarsträubende Geschichte durchsiebt mit Logikfehlern,28,"Im Prinzip hätte The Silent Pateint ein gutes Buch werden können. Das Basiskonstrukt der Geschichte ist gut, was am Ende daraus gemacht wurde, ist jedoch eine hanebüchene Geschichte mit so vielen Logikfehlern und befremdlichem Verhalten der Protagonisten, dass der Leser aus dem Kopfschütteln nicht mehr herauskommt. Die Story umfasst einen Psychotherapeuten, der unbedingt eine Frau behandeln möchte, die vor ein paar Jahren ihren Mann umgebracht und seitdem das Reden eingestellt hat. Wie es der Zufall so will, bewirbt er sich einfach in ihrer Unterbringung, bekommt den Job als behandelnder Arzt und erhält auch direkt die Möglichkeit mit seinem Vorhaben zu beginnen. Dabei macht er aus seinem umfangreichen Interesse an der Patientin keinen Hehl. Muss er aber auch nicht, da niemand hinterfragt wieso er an seinem ersten Arbeitstag direkt eine bestimmte Patientin aussucht und inquisitorisch jeden über sie ausfragt. Gott sei Dank hat er aber auch jede Menge Zeit, denn er muss auch keine anderen Patienten behandeln und kann sich voll und ganz auf die eine Patientin fokussieren. Warum dies so ist und warum ein Arzt für eine Patientin eingestellt wird, bleibt offen. Auch über das Verhältnis zwischen Arzt und Patientin lässt sich wundern: Zwischen einem Therapeuten und seiner Patientin wäre ein etwas distanzierteres Verhältnis wünschenswert gewesen. Aber auch wenn nicht, wieso stellt das niemand der anderen Protagonisten in Frage? Wieso finden es alle ganz normal, dass der Arzt eine so enge und obsessive Bindung zu einer Patientin aufbaut? Als er mit seiner Behandlung nicht weiterkommt, fängt er an zu ermitteln: Selbstgerecht, unempathisch und fern ab von logischem Verhalten stürzt er sich auf die Vergangenheit der Patientin. Natürlich ist er bei der Suche nach Antworten auch irgendwann erfolgreich und der Leser wird mit einem Plottwist belohnt, welcher meines Erachtens noch das Beste an dem Buch war. Leider zeigt sich hier, dass der Autor auch wirklich nur die Idee der Grundstory hatte und zwar die von einer Frau, die ihren Mann ermordet, einem Protagonisten der alles nach vollziehen möchte und dem hier nicht weiter zu erläuternden Plottwist. Alles was der Autor an Inhalten hinzugefügt hat um auf seine über 300 Seiten zu kommen, ist leider inhaltsleeres, unlogisches und arg konstruiertes Füllmaterial. Die Grundstory des Buches ist dennoch gut, wäre nicht das stümperhafte Vorgehen des Therapeuten und die schwachen Dialoge. Der Protagonist platzt ständig mit unangebracht direkten Fragen (bspw. in seinen ""Verhören"" der Angehörigen) oder unfundierten Meinungen heraus. Ein Beispiel: Die Patientin sticht einer anderen ein Auge aus. Wie es dazu kommt, ist und bleibt unklar. Obwohl sich die Täterin als hochgradig aggressiv zeigt und bis dahin immer noch keinen Mucks von sich gegeben hat, ist der Arzt überzeugt, dass es sich um eine Provokation handeln musste und stellt dies als Tatsache gegenpüber seiner Kollegen und auch dem Opfer dar. Vermutlich soll dieser Handlungsabschnitt zeigen wie sehr der Therapeut an das Gute in seiner Patientin glaubt. Leider ist auch dies wieder äußerst plump umgesetzt. Natürlich sind das alles Kleinigkeiten und es gibt sicher viele Leser, die wohlwollende darüber hinwegsehen können. Das Problem ist nur, dass diese Art von unglaublichen Situationen und Dialogen leider gefühlt alle zwei Seiten auftreten, aber mindestens in jedem Kapitel. Somit summieren sich diese ""kleinen Fehlerchen"" zu einer großen haarsträubenden Geschichte zusammen. Fazit: Ein tolles Buch, wenn man bereits eine Flasche Rotwein getrunken hat. Man kann der Story immer noch folgen (wenn man zwischendrin mal gedanklich abschweift ist es auch nicht tragisch) und über die diversen Logikfehler lässt sich größzügiger hinweg sehen. Für die (semi)nüchternen Leser unter Ihnen empfehle ich maximal den Anfang und dann direkt das Ende zu lesen - das spart viel Zeit und die Story kriegt man auch im Groben und Ganzen mit.

I didn't feel like this book had lots of twists and turns...sure there were many characters with motivates and possible psychological issues that could have killed the husband. But then again, was it really so many possibilities? Was it just a way to side track and distract the reader with dribble so this could be a novel? The characters were lifeless (no character development), in my opinion and never developed into characters at all. The author skimmed the surface and presented convenient twists for the his own purpose that were so inept. The author, whom normally writes screen plays, attempts his first novel using some of his own knowledge: working at a psychiatric ward, receiving counseling and going back to school to study psychology. The author also enjoyed murder mysteries (which I was hopefully this would be like). I suppose it could be a great read if your imagination and common thought processes are somehow engrossed in the characters and smittened by the possible ""who -dunn-it theories.""

125030170X,1.0,Just Horrible...,1,"This was the one thriller I had on my Christmas list and I was SO excited to pick it up. 50 pages in and I actually want to burn this book it's so bad. As a rule I don't read many male authors in this genre (not to paint with too broad of a stroke) and this book is a lesson to stick to that rule. Right away I thought I would like this book. The mystery seemed interesting, and while I'm not a therapist I have spent quite a lot of time in therapy and have considered it as a career path for myself. I have also read quite a few books around emotional and physical trauma (Pete Walker, Alice Miller). I was shocked to read that the abuse the protagonist faced as a child was also (nearly verbatim) what I lived through during my formative years with my dad. So maybe this book was a little too close to home for those reasons. The author's representation of women (at least in the first 50 pages) are as beautiful, delicate figures of mystery with translucent skin. Even as the author was talking about how the protagonist met and formed a relationship with his wife, all I learned about her was that she had beautiful, emerald green eyes, an accomodating disposition, and translucent skin. REALLY?! This book immediately felt like an antiquated story of how a man rescues a ""crazy"" woman, or is needed to ""fix"" her. The world-building had potential, but there was so much time spent on the protagonist's inner-musings that it was hard to envision physically where the protagonist was in the story. Reading this book was an experience of feeling trapped in the mind of an extremely annoying, self-absorbed, and entitled guy who sees women as objects or a means to get something he wants (or just prove something to himself/others). It's hard for me to believe this protagonist could have (fictionally) seen any type of success as a therapist. It's even more surprising to read that the author studied English literature at Cambridge, because it does not show whatsoever. Maybe this book improves after the first 50 pages. I don't know. I would try to finish it and let you know but I made a promise to my therapist that I wouldn't self-harm.",FALSE,children

At the very least, nothing in the book is an outright lie or intentionally misleading. What a good twist is not is a first person POV narrator presenting events as if they're happening at the current time when they actually happened six years earlier. The author intentionally misled the reader when it came to the chronology so that they couldn't figure out the twist. That's just cheating and misdirecting in the cheapest, worst, most underhanded and manipulative way possible. That, to me, is not a good book. Plus the writing was meh.

The last time I read a novel with 3 page chapters was probably the Magic Treehouse when I was eight. Anyways, the authors writing is poor and he shows absolutely no character development or detail. I felt absolutely nothing towards these characters, they were completely banal. I love books with detail that paint a picture, if you do too, don’t get this book. It was the complete opposite of that. Not to mention this book doesn’t even make sense when it gets to the twist. The timeline is inaccurate and the author basically cheats the reader by making you think the ending could possibly not have been that way because there’s like a 6 year gap in between what’s happening but he never explains this. Also, the therapeutic relationship between the main character, who’s the therapist, and Alicia is unethical and unprofessional to every degree. This guy knows absolutely nothing about therapy, HIPPA and confidentiality, mental health or what it means to be a clinician/counselor (I’m a therapist).

I don't know who's more at fault - the writer himself or the editor. Each character introduced lacked thoughtful character development. One after the next, we get to know each character at surface level with lackluster plot lines. Amelia's journal entries were reminiscent of what we saw in Gone Girl and other books of this genre. This to me is where the real laziness came in. Providing journal entries as the gateway for the reader to understand the character is a fabulous idea when executed well. Each entry left me thinking ""what does this tell me that the narrator hasn't already explained?"" It felt as though they were crafted by the narrator himself, vs. the character who I'm supposed to believe wrote them. My last and greatest disappointment comes from the fleeting attempts at symbolism & significance. The snowstorm, the Greek tragedy, and Amelia's artwork specifically. Each are referenced as something of importance, sporadically appearing throughout the book. Sadly, each one lacked the real ""A-HA"" moment of realizing its true significance to further tell the story.",TRUE,children

(4) the author's knowledge (I use the term loosely) of psychiatry and psychiatric illness is pitiful. The caveat that ""borderlines are seductive"" is repeated ad nauseam, yet I don't recall Alicia ever being diagnosed with such - never mind that most mental health professionals nowadays hesitate to affix the 'borderline' label because of its enormous stigma. (5) the 'celebrity' endorsements - how the frilly heck did that happen? I mean, please, tell me. Because for the life of me I can't figure it out. This is just a really, really, really bad book.

125030170X,1.0,The Emperor Has No Clothes,9,"THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES... NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD BUT WORSE; DUMB. This book was laughably stupid. I picked it up after all the “hype” and after a few pages that nagging sinking feeling started to manifest. In the end I was left with a feeling south of meh. What makes me irritated is how stupid the story was. I mean face palm WOW dumb. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me explain: #5 — THE UNTRUSTWORTHY NARRATOR GOES SPLAT This is a trope that has been used to great effect in stories. It can really leave the reader on edge and when handled well create a tense, suspenseful atmosphere where nothing can be trusted and big surprises can spring up. It can also leave the story ambiguous leading to thought provoking questions that linger in the readers minds. You ponder the nature of the narrator and wonder what was accurate or what was real and what was false. THIS STORY HAS NONE OF THAT. Theo is without a doubt one of the most on the nose antagonists I’ve ever listened to. I guessed the “twist” to about 85% accuracy and was off on some of the details but it’s easy to see right away THIS MAN IS A PSYCHOPATH within the first 20 pages. Theo has no depth or mystery. He is on the nose nuts and you know immediately he had something directly to do with the murder and Alicia. His cliche’ therapy slogans were embarrassingly bad. I will admit the author may have written them on purpose as a extremely obvious tell so I could be wrong??? #4 — DON’T TRUST THE DOCTORS I’m no therapist or doctor but the medical “professionals” in this book were bat shit crazy. I doubt there was any research done on real therapists or those who work in these institutions. If this is “true” then we should all be very afraid. Also, do doctors routinely refer female patients as “bitches” because that’s what women are called in this book by their doctors. This was so junior high level stuff it took me out of the story every time. Even if it was on purpose to get across some point it was handled so poorly by the author it comes off as laugh out loud ridiculous. #3 — TWISTER FAIL A twist in a story is something unexpected that surprises the reader. I repeat, it is something that SURPRISES the reader. This twist was a joke. It was obvious as I’ve said, Theo was the bad guy. To make it worse, the plot was so convoluted and full of plot holes that when the “twist” is revealed I was still trying to wrap my brain around the convoluted “reveal” #2 — GREETINGS EARTHLING Another major issue I had with this book is there are no humans in it. Seriously, no one in this book behaves like a human being, but instead acts like they live in Melrose Place. Hard to relate to aliens who behave in ways no one would. Theo’s “reason” for breaking into Alicia’s house and tying Gabriel up was so bizarre and convoluted it made any hope of drama bleed out quickly. The motivations were what I would expect from a 15 year old. #1 — GUILTY BY BOREDOM In the end, this book is guilty of the worst crime a book like this can be guilty of; being boring. I was eye rolling bored through this slog. Most of the plot lines were of no consequence and were cheesy red herrings. The characters were boring, the plot was a disaster and the end fell completely flat. The people who inhabited this world were boring aliens. Even all the cliches this book is packed with were duuuulllllll. SINCERELY DISAPPOINTED.

I found myself skimming through pages because the writing was way too simplistic. Most YA novels come across more sophisticated. The author has a terrible take on women and reduces all of them to cheesy caricatures. The whore, the motherly doctor, the damaged damsel...it goes on and on. And apparently women in his world are either waif thin or morbidly obese. This plays out most grossly when the author feels the need to take a shot at Kathy's weight in the end. Her infidelity is one thing but omg she got fat too??? That's the real unforgivable sin, apparently. According to his psycho babble nonsense, we're all doomed from the start because of our universally bad mothers. I rolled my eyes so often I worried they'd get stuck. Most, if not all, of the references to mental health care and providers is wildly off the mark. I'm guessing the author either had the world's worst therapist at some point or has never spoken to one. And he definitely should because his Mommy/Daddy issues leap off the page. There's a big dose of borrowed gravity from Greek tragedies, both explicit and implicit. It all seemed very forced and inorganic. The big twist at the end was not very surprising. The narrator is obviously a bad guy from the start and his motives were pretty clear. Also, the timeline of events doesn't really make sense the way it's presented. I guess the parts of the book covering Kathy's affair were supposed to be in the past but that's not how it's presented. Seemed like a lazy way to force a ""twist"".

125030170X,1.0,Fascination of the Abomination,,"I had nothing to read on a trip back from Dulles and searched in the literary desert that is Hudson News for something at least vaguely engaging. I picked up “The Maidens.” After reading 40 or so pages involving a meet cute and a guy standing outside and staring into a woman’s window (can we just eradicate this creepiness from our culture before addressing much more trivial ‘“me” issues?), I decided to take the much-lauded “The Silent Patient” out of the library to see if my impression of the flimsiness of “The Maidens” was just an aberration from the debut BLOCKBUSTER. Uh, no. The first novel is equally drippy, with a meet cute and a man standing and staring outside a woman’s house. (Are we feeding into some lizard-mind behavior we want to continue to foster? Yet, as simply bad as this novel is, I was driven to finish it, just not believing how awful it was. Conrad’s “fascination of the abomination” came to mind as I turned each page with a mixed sense of reluctance and fascination. Anyway, following are some observations that may prove useful to a potential reader. (May God have mercy on your soul!). I will try to avoid “spoilers,” but it is difficult to spoil something that is already horribly spoiled (rotten). 1) The novel begins with a diary entry. Even though the writer of this document says that she doesn’t want to call it a “diary,” the author labels it as such. Apparently, they did not consult each other on this issue. And, to be fair, it is not a diary, but a means of continuing the narrative. You really cannot tell the difference between the “diarist’s” narrative style and that of the frame narrator. There is no difference in sentence structure, tone, voice— simply no difference at all. Methinks the author lacks the talent for such literary “nuance.” 2) A crime is committed at the beginning of the novel. That crime is blamed on one perpetrator; there apparently can be no other. Yet, as the frame narrator, who is a psychotherapist, begins to uncover the clues to the crime, the reader has to believe that the London detectives assigned to this case were the biggest dumbarses EVER. It’s also curious why the frame narrator spends so much time trying to unravel the mystery when he already knows what happened. Ooh, I think that’s a spoiler. Now you’ll have to enjoy the book on its literary merit alone. Good luck. 3) The psychotherapist admits to being messed up because of his father. When he meets cute and eventually gets engaged, his FIRST thought is that he needs to take his fiancee home to meet his father. Wha…? 4) The psychotherapist manages to get assigned to the clinic where the person accused of the crime is being treated. While the clinic has plenty of other patients, this dude is somehow allowed to spend all of his time with one patient. And only one other patient in the joint is given a name, because she has a role in advancing what serves as a plot. In addition, the frame narrator apparently has carte blanche on setting his schedule. He is away from the clinic so much in sweeping up after the stupid London detectives that, anywhere else than in this electrifying novel, he would be fired. 5) Just some other items, very quickly, so you can go out and buy this book IMMEDIATELY: The patient’s husband is a photographer who has made a name for himself with photos of “semi-nude, semi-emaciated” women (of course). Yet, later in the book, the narrator says that the husband is attracted to a world of “light and color.” Well, no. The patient is a painter who is quite deliberate in structuring her art, possessed with making multiple sketches to get details just right. Yet when she gets access to painting materials in the clinic, she lines up the paints and begins to paint immediately with no preparation, all the while creating her art in her signature style. It’s embarrassing!! Finally (not really. I could go on), one might think that the “diarist”/patient’s belongings would be searched upon entering the clinic. Yet, six years or so after her being admitted, she produces her diary for the psychotherapist to read. Now where did that come from? There is absolutely no mention of her ever being a mule for a Mexican cartel. G.K. Chesterton wrote: “A good novel tells us the truth about its hero; a bad novel tells us the truth about its author. It does much more than that, it tells us the truth about its readers; and, oddly enough, it tells us all the more the more cynical and immoral be the motive of its manufacture.” Mr. Chesterton rests my case.",FALSE,children

But it’s so unfair to some of the talented writers out there struggling to get a look in. Plot? Ridiculous. Knowledge of psychotherapy? Verging on dangerous and for the most part unethically represented. Writing style? Cringe worthy , stilted and overly explanatory ... what happened to the ‘show not tell’ mantra of good creative writing? Character development? Embarrassingly one dimensional and frankly boring. Twists? Seriously ... it’s a joke! And as for the typos, the confusing misuse of tenses and basic grammar - horrifying! And the guy supposedly has a degree in English Literature from Cambridge! I predict that this, when played out on the silver screen, headlined no doubt by another big celebrity like Thurman or Lawerence, will flop in the same way Mr Michaelidis’ other two screenplays did.

I worked on a psych ward and believe me, nobody cared about the language the patients used, but there would have been great concern throwing around a potential weapon. The author seems to have missed the fact that Freud has been largely discredited. But in this book, they are using psychoanalysis on the criminally insane, who wouldn't have gotten that diagnosis unless they were deeply psychotic. I finished the book just because I wanted to see how many stupid things the author could come with.

I'm utterly disappointed in the story and honestly unsure how it received so many five-star reviews. The praise was strong with this one, so I was sure I was going to read an epic tale. Alas, this is not the case. The Silent Patient is about Alicia, an artist, who murders Gabriel, her photographer husband, and never speaks again. The same night she murders her husband, she also attempts suicide. After being triad for her crimes, she convinces a jury that she is guilty only because of her emotional and mental duress, so she's admitted into a psychiatric ward and put under the care of Theo, the protagonist of this story and also a psychiatrist who's strangely obsessed with Alicia. The story is told in dual timelines, shifting between Alicia's diary entries and Theo's internal monologue. The ending is twisty enough for me not to see coming, but unfortunately, that's the only praise I have for this one. My main issue with this book--and there are a lot of them--is the pacing. It's just SO SLOW. I picked up and put down this book at least four or five times. I was determined to finish it. I kept telling myself it HAS to be good. Look at those reviews! It's critically acclaimed! It's being made into a movie! It has all the accolades for a great story. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The horrendous pacing meant I lost interested immediately. I'm not kidding. I couldn't get past chapter three without wanting to take a snooze. I'm not sure what's happening, but there seems to be a shift in the industry lately. So many authors are writing SLOW thrillers. There's nothing thrilling about this book. I guess I like a fast-paced thriller. I want to be gripped from page one, not when I reach the final chapter. Aside from the awful pacing, I must agree with other reviewers who have chastised the character development and representation of mental health and psychiatry as a profession. There really isn't much redeemable about this one. And truly, that breaks my heart. The premise had such promise. I do love that cover, though.",FALSE,children

125030170X,1.0,Wish I’d Never Heard the Silent Patient,2,"I’ve got to find a site with more discerning reviewers - I’m mystified by the rave reviews for this book. I liked nothing about it. The prose was a tepid slog from cliche to cliche, through long dreary passages and countless bits of pointless dialogue that did nothing to advance the narrative or enhance the bland characters. The narrator and other characters were psychiatrists but all the discussion of psychology and therapy read as if written by someone whose total exposure to the subject comes from soap operas and lesser Hollywood wannabe thrillers. To call it sophomoric would suggest exposure to at least a college freshman Psych class but even that may be too generous. Some of the discussion about legal process - while not critical to the narrative - was silly. And - SPOILER ALERT - the long, tedious passages about the narrator’s past psychological issues were a neon signal from early in the novel that he would end up being the villain, so there was not even the thrill of a major unexpected twist (I don’t much care whether I succeed or fail in an early guess about who the villain is, but with this book it was the last hope for something interesting; there was a modest “twist” but it came off to me as contrived and unconvincing). Finally, I “read” the book via audiobook and found the narrator irritating. He seemed to often get the intonation wrong as compared to what I “heard” from the text - but on that count perhaps it’s “just me” (something I don’t feel about the poor writing and general inanity of the book). I several times was on the threshold of abandoning ship on this book, but it’s human nature - or at least mine - to see the journey through to its destination. I’m relieved to disembark and hope the next journey is far more interesting.",FALSE,children

125030170X,1.0,This particular *twist* mechanism doesn’t work. It’s cheap. Plain and simple ... (spoilers ahead!),11,"This particular *twist* mechanism doesn’t work. It’s cheap. Plain and simple, it’s unskilled storytelling. Normally I would abandon this kind of book early on -- the writing is jejune (yes, this is a fantastic and sorely underused word). I’m curious why dialogue is so strained since Michaelides is a screenwriter. It’s wooden. At times, the characters certainly speak like they’re “in the movies” -- it's tacky without the facial expressions to support them -- but other times they’re saying things that real people, whether fictive or not, don’t say. Also, like in the movies, scenes with minor characters just sort of pop-up and serve no real purpose. They have been intended as red-herrings, but they just sort of come across as misplaced and unnecessary. But also the place is off. It’s set in London and yet most of the spelling and details ring American (ie: gray not grey, baseball bat, lawyers, gun laws). And the characters’ nationalities are a mess. At one point Kathy is an American actress in London, but then Theo tells us she had to practice her American accent for two weeks while she rehearsed her role in “All My Sons.” Gabriel, too, is American, but his brother is a lawyer in London. Don’t you mean, a barrister? And why does he represent the woman who murdered his brother? No one speaks with any difference. Every now and then they’ll use a colloquialism, such as “mate,” but that’s random and weird. And multiple characters will use similar pet names like “darling” without any consistency, as if it’s a normal way to address someone. Essentially, Michaelides hasn’t made strong choices about his characters. Unless of course you count the glaringly obvious name of his main character. Theo. Faber. Anyone up on their Ancient Greek and Latin? At times, the writer seems to confuse his narrator and main character. Theo Faber is telling the story and yet he doesn’t know things he knows. For instance, early on Theo gives us a brief synopsis of Euripides’s “Alcestis,” telling us it’s “a love story of the saddest kind” -- which it isn’t, but I’ll get to that below -- and then at some point in part three or four (I lost track), he buys a copy of the tragedy and reads it and is stunned to discover Alcestis doesn’t speak once she returns from death, which he deduces is related to Alicia’s reasons for not speaking. Maybe Michaelides thought using Euripides would bring heft and depth to an otherwise shallow story. But Alcestis is not well-served here. She’s supposed to be a thematic figure because she also doesn’t speak at the end of Euripides’s tragedy. Her silence has nothing to do with her sacrifice -- of which there is none in Michaelides’s story. Instead, when Alcestis returns from Hades she’s still dead, which is implied when Heracles says she’ll speak in three days. There’s a sense that rituals have to be performed before she can talk to the living because she has been with the dead. Three days is significant. There’s plenty of accessible scholarly work on it. I suppose I’m most miffed because Michaelides incorporates the myth like a child picking up his father’s sword and flailing it around without skill or strength to wield it. Let me be frank. As reviews go, mine pans the book ... SPOILERS AHEAD!! SPOILERS AHEAD!! SPOILERS AHEAD!! First and foremost is the blatant abuse of the reader with regard to the timeline. The story is broken into parts and chapters, which include both Theo’s account and Alicia’s journal entries -- a journal I might add that no one at the psychiatric institute realized she *snuck* in when she was imprisoned there. But jumping back and forth between time without giving clear indication that you are doing so is cheating because it’s necessary for the twist. Without that dissembling, the story falls apart. The reader, then, can’t trust the writer. It’s not about a reliable or unreliable narrator. It’s about a reliable (and skilled enough) writer. I won’t even go into the irresponsible mess of a psychiatric ward that is “The Grove.” This whole bit, which is a major part of the plot, is so embarrassingly inaccurate I can’t even. I’m not a psychiatrist or psychotherapist, and I’ve never been hospitalized, but I’ve seen movies and plays and read books that portray this world with far more accuracy and sensitivity. The WHY’s are weak. Thrillers rely on the WHY’s. There’s no reason for Theo to seek out Alicia six years later and coax her into confessing something he knows she did. There’s no reason why he needs to know why. Maybe it’s because her husband was cheating. Maybe her husband abused her incessantly. Maybe it’s because Theo came into her home wearing a mask and traumatized her to the point where she thought she was shooting him instead of her husband. Why go through all of the rigmarole to learn something Theo doesn’t need to know only to kill her when she begins speaking about it? I would’ve been fine if we’d been shown that Theo Faber is actually sadistic and psychopathic and got off on that kind of thing. But he’s emotional, he’s aware of right and wrong, and nothing in the narrative offers this nefarious behavior as explanation. Yes, he was abused as a child. Plenty of people are, unfortunately. But there’s a difference between causation and correlation. His abuse doesn’t necessarily cause him to react the same, but if he acts out abusively it may be correlated with his past experience. But timeline and characters and motives aren’t the only problems here. There are some very simple inconsistencies and inaccuracies that are just embarrassing. Details as small and easy to fix as Paul, who lives in Cambridge, hitting Theo over the head with a baseball bat. A cricket bat, I’d buy. But do Brits play baseball? And if so do *mates* keep bats in their houses? Alicia is rich because her father left her money after he died, enough to make her set for life since Gabriel leaves his to his brother, and yet she can’t pay off her cousin’s debt of “twenty grand” (which in British slang would be twenty thousand grand, I think)? The rifle, too, is silly. How big are the kitchen cupboards in a London home? Can you store a rifle in the one beside the drinking glasses? Really? Why is it loaded? Doesn’t it have to be loaded after each shot? What are the gun laws in London? Are they as loose as in America? And does Alicia -- who despises guns -- know how to shoot off five shots? I mean, she’s probably never held the thing but she can take five shots at someone’s face at close range? I don’t think I can even get into how silly Alicia comes off. The emptiness of her as a character. The unrealistic way she’s drawn. I mean, she’s not even *not* likable. She’s kind of just a cardboard flap, like the girl whose mouth is torn on the cover. I’m not sure she’s mentally ill, either. Or why she’s considered mentally ill. She was supposedly mentally ill since her father said he wished she’d died instead of her mother. That apparently “killed her like Alcestis.” (Um, no. Alcestis offers herself up as sacrifice for her weak-willed, selfish husband, Admetus. She dies for him, instead of him.) The silly drama Theo creates with the threat of killing Alicia in front of Gabriel, forcing him to admit he doesn’t want to die (yah, fair enough, who does?) has nothing to do with Euripides’s “Alcestis” or Alcestis’s mythology. This isn’t comparable. And apparently Theo doesn’t know anything about Alcestis at that point, so why would he think what he did has anything to do with it? Alicia painted her Alcestis painting a month before the incident, too. Yep, the timeline is a jumbled mess. This novel felt like a draft of a manuscript that had potential.

Sorry to say but this is another of the over-hyped books that appear from time to time - Girl on the Train being perhaps the worst of them all, with this one not far behind. The details of psychology and therapy are inaccurate and as this forms the essence of the book’s setting and plot, the book fails in its ‘possible authenticity’. The characters are only weakly developed. The key ‘trick’ to the book is deception - the reader simply didn’t have a chance and so ultimately the book wasn’t well-written or well-plotted, it was a simply a lack of information to the reader. Setting a story in a psychiatric institution and adding a patient and a psychotherapist does not make a psychological thriller. The back cover includes, ‘I read it in a state of intense, breathless excitement’ - Stephen Fry. I find this sort of pap on book covers to be insulting to those who hand over hard-earned wages to a corrupt industry’s shysters. Like Fry, the author is also a Cambridge graduate, so I guess there’s some sort of hype-fraternity', but you would think a graduate of literature from even a high school would not make writing errors like the ones in this book.

Second, while there was a murder, it was long ago, and the ""red herring"" evidence presented at the beginning of the story was totally unconvincing to the reader (although surprisingly, the court and other authorities bought it). No particular identification or empathy with the victim or the accused perpetrator. Third, the main conflict is primarily internal, between doctor and patient. Will he get her to talk again? What will she say? Not exactly tense, nor action-packed. Fourth, the book breaks a typical unwritten contract between mystery author, narrator and reader. I'd tell you which one, but it would be a spoiler. The result is that after I closed the book, I thought for a moment and said, ""Wait! You cheated!""

I agreed with another reviewer, that it seems like the author hits on many ""woke"" talking points rather than making her book interesting. What an insult to readers to assume that will be enough to keep her readers entertained. Regarding the woke talking points, she doesn't expound on them at all, so these points come off vapid and shallow unfortunately; like she's just throwing them in there to virtue signal. She should articulate her points, if she felt it necessary to introduce them to the plot. Finally, the book is a LGBT+ story, which I really liked, as it could have been an unexpected path to take the story; could make it less boring. But the additional characters are so one dimensional, and not complex. Almost insulting. Why not focus more on those characters, their stories, if that is a huge aspect of the plot?

One big problem with the characters is that there is so much awe heaped onto them, so much emotional verbage surrounding them, yet I don't feel emotionally captivated by them at all. Zero. Zilch. They are wooden, clichéd, obvious stereotypes who just gagged me a little too often.

He is not sure he wants her but he gets angry whenever any other man wants her. He is also very fond of the F word.

Naomi is insecure and has wild codependency issues. Knox is similar to Stabler or Voigt (for those NBC criminal procedural fans)...chock full of violence with a dash of chauvinism.

She should already know the girl is trouble yet arrives in this little town, parks her car, then leaves her handbag in it with her phone and of course, is surprised to find that it's all been stolen. She's just as surprised when she gets to her hotel room and finds it ransacked and everything of worth gone. Well, everything but an 11 year-old smartass, the surprise offspring of said evil twin. The male protaganist is the quintessential macho-male type, projecting much beefiness and hotness (her words) that leave her swooning despite her animosity towards him.

I didn’t like how he was always getting into her business even though she asked him many times not to. There is nothing funny or cute or romantic about a man who pushes his way into whatever a woman is doing, especially after she makes it very clear that he is not wanted around. Even worse when you realize a lot of his behavior is jealousy over Naomi’s interaction with his brother, Nash. Knox doesn’t want her but doesn’t want anyone else to have her. That’s emotional abuse. But I ended reading this book when they were in Victoria’s Secret and he physically put his hand over her mouth to shut her up when she protested about him buying her underwear. That is physical abuse and physical assault, plain and simple and I’m shocked at the number of readers who find this behavior charming because it’s NOT.

Throughout the book, the tense would constantly change. It did not seem that the author connected the past with the present well. There seemed to be a natural ability in some authors to integrate past and present seamlessly. That was not the case with this story. As the story progressed, no action took place.

63215381,1.0,Beim besten Willen kein Thriller,1.0,"Normalerweise schreibe ich keine Rezensionen, aber nach der Lektüre von Lucy Foleys „The Guest List“, musste ich doch mal meine Meinung abgeben. Ich finde, dass das Genre „Thriller“ absolut falsch gewählt ist – viel eher müsste das Buch unter „Drama“ zu finden sein. Bei einem Thriller erwarte ich Spannung. Bei einem „murder mystery thriller“ auch einen Mord, eine Jagd nach dem Täter, die nervenaufreibende Suche nach der Wahrheit und einen oder mehrere Protagonisten, mit denen ich mitfiebern und um deren Wohlergehen ich mir Sorgen machen kann. Stattdessen erwartet den Leser in diesem Buch ein Ensemble an kaputten Gestalten auf einer ebenso quasi verlassenen Insel in den irischen Gewässern eine Hochzeit feiern sollen. Jede dieser Gestalten hat – wie sollte es auch anders sein – eine dunkle Vergangenheit. Doch statt diese als Katalysator dazu zu nutzen, ihre Charaktere im Laufe der Story zu entwickeln, entscheidet sich die Autorin dazu, ihre Figuren aus der Ich-Perspektive an ihrem Schicksal leiden zu lassen. Dabei behält sie aber bis weit über die Halbzeit-Marke hinweg für sich, welche schlimmen Schicksalsschläge die Charaktere erlitten haben. Die Story wird grundsätzlich in zwei Zeitebenen erzählt: Einmal im Jetzt, am Tag der Hochzeit, wo ein blutiger Vorfall passiert ist und die Hochzeitsgäste rätseln und erkunden, was passiert ist. Und dann wird der Vortag der Hochzeit erzählt, in der mehrere Figuren in der Ich-Perspektive erzählen, was sie tun (sehr wenig) und ihnen durch den Kopf geht (sehr viel). Dabei erinnern sie sich an die Vergangenheit und dabei werden immer wieder irgendwelche schrecklichen Vorfälle erwähnt – allerdings ohne näher darauf einzugehen. Das Ergebnis ist ein Buch, das vor allem in der Vergangenheit der Figuren spielt und nur sehr wenig in der Gegenwart. Sie wird quasi aus dem Off erzählt, ist im Grunde reine Exposition und damit schlichtweg langweilig.

Foley has simply recycled her cardboard, cliched characters from `The Hunting Party', changed the names and PC details and plugged them into relationships with the SAME EXACT DYNAMICS as in `The Guest List'. These books seem to have more in common with a paint by numbers kit than a creative endeavor. Eventually, I just started laughing out loud as yet another setting, character, and plot point resurfaced with the scantest of disguises. It's not that funny, though, as I notice that the book is on the NY Times Best Seller list. That this mediocre rehash has sold so well is truly dispiriting. What is also not so amusing is that, since the Quarantine I've been buying books (library is out for now) so I purchased both `The Guest List' and `The Hunting Party'. Instead of `Two books for the Price of One!' it's more like `One Book for the Price of Two!'. I actually feel ripped off.

There is just no redeeming value to adding this literary (and I use the term quite loosely) experience to your imagination. My bloodied copy of the book with all my proofreading corrections quickly found its way into the recycle bin. Waste of trees. Waste of money. Waste of time. My review: The Guest List is my first and last Lucy Foley book. Foremost, the writing is riddled with structural and grammatical errors – so many, that I kept stumbling over many sentences. This sloppy writing (and editing) includes everything from fragmented (in many cases, severely fragmented) sentences, to dangling prepositions, to diction problems (e.g., misusing words as verbs or adjectives when they are not – not even in the Oxford dictionary – and I checked!), to straight-up grammatical errors. After the first 20 pages, the only way I could get through the rest of this book was to whip out my red proofreading pen and treat this reading as an assignment rather than leisure time. And by the time I finished, the margins of this book were bleeding red from my proofreading marks far worse than the author’s victim at the end of the story. This sloppy writing made the book a very tedious and frustrating read and completely distracted from what little interest the story might have otherwise offered. Further, the author speaks in the first person for five distinct characters, as well as occasionally the narrator. Amazing how all the voices in this book were identical and riddled with the same structural and grammatical errors – even the annoying overuse of the word “besides.” The author made no attempt to distinguish these characters’ voices in how they speak or think. This further reduced the authenticity of the entire story. It’s a play where one actor plays all the parts exactly the same way. I concur with other reviewers who commented that the author’s extensive foreshadowing really belittles the intelligence of the reader. If you can’t put all the pieces together by the time Aoife hints at her personal tragedy, you weren’t paying attention – or perhaps you missed the blatant hints because they were obstructed by all the structural and grammatical errors. Similarly, I echo other reviewers’ comments regarding the ludicrous organization of the story as well as the vapid, flat, self-indulgent personalities of every character in the book. These are all acquaintances whom you would quickly dismiss from your real life without a second thought. This makes the book even more tedious to read – having to endure 300 pages of text before you can finally be rid of them. And the whole cheesy, ridiculous story in and of itself?...

Was it a mystery, was it a thriller, was it literary fiction?) If you read the reviews on the book jacket (don’t), they actually give away the twist, which is terrible! But it’s not even a very decent twist, it’s one you’ve likely seen before. The ending didn’t wrap things up in a very satisfying way, either. I’d say I knocked down stars for disliking all the characters, but that is not a good way to grade a book. So instead, what I will say was that it was a slog to get through.

First the idea that someone like the main character Jules, with her glam big city lifestyle and wealth/fame, choosing to hold her wedding in such a godforsaken place is quite laughable. There were several attempts to explain this away - the 50% discount for eg., received in return for featuring the island in her magazine; the way this place was described, you would have to pay ME to hold even a tea party there. Its apparently a tiny Island off the Irish coast, a place well known for its balmy seas and clement weather right? the island itself is an almost continuous peat bog which is described more like an actual swamp/bog/quicksand kind of deal where you can get sucked down to your death at any moment and the rest is lethal sheer cliffs and rocks. It apparently did not occur to the island owner and event holder that safety barriers might be a good thing to stop guests being sucked into the bog. Of course the idea that people at a party, in an unknown location with a MASSIVE unpredictable and mostly invisible hazard could perish by walking from one building to the next seemed perfectly fine. Ridiculous. Next, as horrible as this location sounded, it seemed that at least 2 of the guests actually preferred to sit in a partially subterranean cave subject to flooding, too dark to see the back, full of weird noises, damp, dank and with unknown inhabitants and AT NIGHT !! ... than any other comfortable indoor place. THEN, there was this odd disconnection where the author apparently forgot that she had said that only a select few would be staying in the Folly overnight, but then had hundreds of guests arriving for the day, events merging into the evening and night and no way for them to leave the island! where were they all going? was there a secret submarine evacuation planned, or a bridge she forgot to mention? as it happened, suspense was created by a violent, unpredicted/totally predictable storm which would have made a sea evac by anything other than a Naval destroyer impossible anyway. Forgetting the logistics, the characters were so awful, I hoped they would all murder each other.

There is absolutely no investigation of character by the writer. Everything is a cliche'. Not a thought exists between the covers, either by the characters, the writer or unfortunately the readers.

What this really was: shallow 30-somethings acting like insecure horny teens. The women all focus on how they look, when they last got laid, and when they'll next get laid. The men are either insecure spineless blobs, or part of a clique of crass frat boys, who bully the blobs and harass the women. Everyone has deep issues and insecurities, that they've nurtured and grown over decades, rather than being adults and getting help/moving on. Again, I think this is a very heavy-handed way to do suspense? But the final straw for me was when the best man starts sexually harassing the maid of honor.

63215381,1.0,Hugely Flawed Thriller Overrelies on Coincidence and Fails to Surprise,1.0,"I like a good trashy page-turner as much as the next person, the problem is that this trashy page-turner isn't good. The setting is promising -- a mansion on a small island off the Irish coast has been renovated to become a boutique wedding venue, but there's a storm coming in just in time for the big event. The house has enough space for twelve titular guests (plus the wedding planner and chef husband). This cast is a rather generic set of cardboard types: bride to be runs a fancy lifestyle website, groom stars in a survival-themed reality show, groomsmen are douchey boarding school mates of his, there's the bride's troubled waiflike teenage sister, the bride's best friend and his spunky ""plus one"" Northern wife, with the bride's mother rounding things out. The conceit of these kind of plots, going back to Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little *****s"" (aka ""And Then There Were None"") is that everyone in the group has some kind of dark secret that will come out in the course of the story, and the reader has to work out whose secret is motive enough for murder. In this iteration, the story toggles back and forth between one timeline that starts the day before the wedding, and another that starts with the actual wedding. The idea is to slowly reveal secrets and amp up the pace as the story builds to a crescendo, but the execution is way too choppy. One of the several major flaws of the book is that it will be obvious from very early on who is going to be murdered. Once the reader realizes that, as the various dark secrets of the other characters are revealed, it becomes very easy to slot the future corpse into these backstories and understand why, as the villain of each, they must die. Which is the other major flaw of the book -- it requires the reader to accept three massive coincidences with the future corpse at the nexus of each. The result is that by halfway through the book, the reader will have already sussed out four people with the proper incentive to murder the future corpse.

At first the book appeared to be a ""chick book"", romantic pap for a female audience. Eventually, a complicated story unfolded. It is an historical tale primarily about women, dubbed the packhorse librarians, who delivered books to the far strewn and impoverished residents of southeastern Kentucky during the depression. These women worked for the WPA to provide mobile libraries. It is a story of physical and emotional abuse of women as well as the strength and support women can provide for each other. Out of chronological sequence, the novel begins with an assault which is addressed toward the end of the book with a trial. Along the way, the author paints images of the beauty of the mountains and the brutality of the snowy cold winters and the bug infested summers along winding dangerous horse trails. She includes the punishing work in the coal mines and the stereotypical views of locals toward female literacy and the acquisition of knowledge through reading. Before writing this review, I learned that another book with the title The Book Women of Troublesome Creek by Kim Michele Richardson was published in May 2019 well BEFORE Moyes's novel which appeared in October 2019.

It is upsetting to think Moyes, a popular well known British writer, would take the work of a lesser known American writer and claim so much of it as her own. Apparently, Moyes denies ever reading Richardson’s book. I have just read both books. If you read both, you will likely agree with me . Moyes lives in London and in the 9 month period when she was writing her book she spent time in Kentucky. Richardson, born in Kentucky, spent 4 years researching the Book Women of the 1930's. If you are interested in the historical period, the dialog and setting descriptions, they are far more accurate in Richardson’s book. I was born in Evansville near the Kentucky border. My mother and grandparents farmed in rural Indiana. Books were treasures. Wood was carried in to heat the house. Quilt patterns, recipes, and cures for ailments were pasted in used ledgers. Richardson’s book brought back the stories so often told of freezing winds, long walks to the nearest town and the birth of my mother declared still born until they took her to the outside pump and pumped water on her. Moyes used some of the same descriptions of the rural Kentucky used by Richardson, but her characters though likable are hard to believe. Especially Alice who left her tea party life in England, married a Kentucky man and became a Book Woman. In contrast, Richardson’s characters especially, Cussy Mary and her mule are likable and tough. They are fictional characters but they seem very real to the time and place.

399562494,1.0,Fantastical Romance,8.0,"If this had been sold as a romance and not based on history, I can understand the strong fantasy element to the story, think 50 Shades of Gray without the steam. I've always liked Moyes up until this story. When I found this was supposed to be historical fiction I did a bit of digging before getting too deep into the book and was looking forward to reading about Kentucky heritage where I went to high school. The book is supposed to be about Kentucky pack horse librarians. The cast is highly unlikely, a British woman, a polio victim, a black woman, another woman I don't remember, and a burgeoning suffragette, which is not based on historical fact, instead of using the actual real-life strong women riding through the thickets and backcountry of Kentucky. The women are strong but not accurately portrayed as any of the real women delivering books in Kentucky. The story doesn't reflect Kentucky living and from the word choices, food, and lifestyles felt more appropriately set in the UK. Moyes apparently traveled to Kentucky to research but very little of Kentucky is in the book. The story is a mishmash of the pack horse librarians, Hatfields and McCoys, Kentucky coal mining, and mostly about British living and sensibilities. The gentle rolling hills of Kentucky are called knobs by Kentuckians, not mountains. Skittles candy was not invented at that time and are British though it could've been referring to the European game, which is called bowling in the States. Kiddies is another British term. Bacon and eggs are traditionally an English breakfast and tea is not a favorite beverage in the hills of Kentucky, more likely grits and biscuits and gravy and bourbon. No country ham smothered in red-eye gravy either in this book. The lack of setting and research is disappointing and feels more like a story set in the UK. The story should be marketed as a romance and not based on fact. Normally I give 2 stars to any book I get through but after reading an article on BuzzFeeds I will be reading another author's work where apparently this story was lifted from and was much better researched. The article infers plagiarism and I hope justice if merited is duly served.",FALSE,children
399562494,1.0,Recycled Characters in a Predictable Plot,8.0,"Marge, Alice, Beth, Izzy and Sophia are a tight group of women who ride horseback to bring the library to country folk living deep in the forests (except Sophia). All of these characters are tired old tropes. Marge is an independent woman who doesn't play by the rules, Alice is in a loveless marriage, Izzy is a woman with a disability who doesn't know her own potential, Beth is gruff and is only there to drive dialogue and Sophia is the wise African American woman capable of performing miscellaneous skills such as fixing book covers and being a midwife at just the right time. All of the woman are surrounded by one dimensional men who are either mean and ignorant or unconditionally admiring. Yes bringing enlightenment through books to uneducated ""folk"" is nice but where it goes too far into chic-lit-land is when the plot gets contrived. For example, After her divorce, Alice has a job, a place to live, friends, a man that cares for her who she cares for and yet ""must go home to England"". Why? To create a plot point?

""It was, everyone agreed, fanning themselves outside the store or passing in the shade of the eucalyptus trees..."" Moyes has native Australian Eucalyptus trees growing in eastern KY. A fantasy. They can’t grow there and never have. This important library initiative and the KY pack horse women and men deserved better than a Brit trying to write their history in a ‘fevered frenzy over the holidays’ as Moyes claimed. Made it up to page 20 when I discovered additional historical errors in passages which stopped me cold. “I am asking for some ladies to contribute to our civic good and sign up. The WPA will provide the horse and books.” These Kentuckians were not volunteers. The librarians had to supply their own horses and all the books. FDR initiated the book program to put the poor women of eastern KY to work. 1930s in KY was filled with abject poverty and extreme starvation. Kentuckians certainly wouldn’t have allowed a foreigner to come in and take their jobs and steal food out of their families mouths and off their tables... though it feels like this is exactly what Moyes has done. There are countless other inaccuracies and exhausted clichés and stockpile characters throughout, from the collards and apple pie moonshine which were not present at that time, to the offensive dumbing-down and exhaustive, recyclable use of 'hillbilly'. Like many others stated in their reviews above, I agree it doesn't pass the smell test, and Moyes weak defense of zeitgeist strains credulity. Buzzfeed reported in its article that while Moyes publisher was reviewing Richardsons finished manuscript in September 2017, Moyes wrote a giddy post on her public Facebook page seeking excuses/exonerations/ideas should the day come if she got caught and or was accused of borrowing liberally by writing what someone else already did. Many professional educators, teachers and librarians will tell you if a dozen or twelve dozen people are asked to write 25 words about the same topic they will all write different versions. All damning and revealing. British romance author Moyes has given a poor representation of the beloved relief program about these indomitable women and the crippling times they lived through, to capitalize on gaining more wealth and fame by using KY and its people to try to claim something which a native Kentuckian had first. Moyes has been accused of this before in 2009 and because its rarely a first time, only a ‘first time getting caught’, I hope the KY author of the original work not only goes after Moyes civilly in the courts but also pursues it criminally which under CI law would mean a stiff fine and prison sentence.",FALSE,children

399562494,1.0,"Lazy Author, Lazy Editors",18.0,"The entire book smacks of laziness on the part of the author and her editors. If you're writing a historical piece set in another nation, do a little research. From page one the book is riddled with errors. Eucalyptus doesn't grow in Kentucky, it's too cold. Characters are constantly traveling to Lexington. Lexington is at least 70 miles away from the location of the story. People in 1930s Appalachia didn't routinely travel 70 miles given most of the roads were dirt and very few even had access to a car. Their speech does not in any way resemble the speech of Appalachian people. When she does attempt to have a character speak in the vernacular, she gets it all wrong, in particular various characters' use of the term ""youse"" which was downright laughable. Did they move to Appalachia from Brooklyn or Jersey City? ""Youse"" is northern, urban speech, not Kentucky mountain speech. Other readers complain of Moyes' plagiarism from the Book Woman of Troublesome Creek but in addition she's loosely borrowed incidents from Thelma & Louise (the scene in the bar) and Fried Green Tomatoes (the town's ""free spirit"" accused of murder). Other blatant errors - the book takes place in 1937-38. One of the main characters is 38 years old and one incident from her early childhood involves nobody being able to hear the ""wireless."" Of course they couldn't hear it, there was nothing to hear. The first radio broadcasts for the public didn't come along until 1920, when this character would have been a young woman and poor mountain people would not have been able to afford radios regardless. There are constant changes to the story, sometimes one character is alone because his wife died, then in another part, she's left him. The mule changes back and froth into a horse (""She climbed off the mule and unbuckled the girth from the horse's belly""). A character is bundled in layers of clothes, presumably because it's cold, and then goes out to watch fireflies. During the trial the town was full of mobile homes presumably for the media. In 1938??? September woods were thick with fallen leaves. In Kentucky? Even up north the leaves are just turning in September. And then there is the constant use of the derogatory term ""hillbilly."" My next door neighbors were from the very region described in the book, they'd worked the mines and older relatives had died of black lung. Never once did I hear them utter the word ""hillbillly."" Or say ""youse."" On top of the endless errors in the book, the story is nothing special and the ending is ludicrous. Moyes should have spent a little time researching the area (she could have read Coal Miner's Daughter for a first person look at Depression-era Appalachia, or some of the writing of Fannie Flagg for a taste of true Southern American speech. Or the novel Christy, based on the author's mother's own experiences as a teacher in Appalachia, or Letters to Lori, written by an Appalachian woman.) And then thought up a decent tale that honored the women of Appalachia and the horseback librarians, rather than a cheesy Harlequin romance filled with mistakes.

I bought this on the basis of a NYT Book Review feature on beach reads. I didn't care that the plot - including the 'meet cute' - was ripped off from When Harry Met Sally. It's a durable premise because it does happen in real life. I knew about 30 pages in what the ending would be, but was curious to see how these two characters would get there. What I didn't expect was how truly awful the writing was. Repetitive descriptions, poorly drawn secondary characters, implausible plot turns. Not to mention that because of all that repetition, the book was about a third longer than it needed to be. Since I've never read any other books written by this author, I do hope they are a little better than this. I would hate to think that mass market publishing has sunk to producing books that could be better written by a high school junior, but in this case I'm not inclined to spend more money and/or time trying to find out.",FALSE,children

1984806750,1.0,Predictable & Boring,,"I really disliked this book. On the basis of a friend’s recommendation, I previously read Beach Read by Emily Henry and disliked it. I thought perhaps this book, being her second novel, would be better. It wasn’t. The story is told is mostly alternating chapters of “this summer” and previous summers, going back six summers ago, all from Poppy’s POV. Poppy and Alex are platonic friends who take a summer vacation together each year, at least until two years ago when something happened between them, and they have not spoken to one another for the two years since that last trip. What happened is the only mystery in the book. The rest is predictable. Over time, the reader finds out what happened two summers ago and the only mystery is solved. Honestly, it’s not that big of a deal. The “this summer” chapters are the main plot of the book as the couple do agree to take a summer trip together, and of course, the most obvious outcomes occurs. The writing has numerous issues. There are a few POV shifts, even mid-paragraph, which were disturbing to the flow of the prose. There is a plot hole regarding the vehicle with the flat tire. One minute they were on the side of the road with a flat, next minute they were back to their hotel. What happened to the car with the flat tire is never explained. The characters were typical millennials with their entitlement attitudes and feelings of ennui. I didn’t care for either Poppy or Alex. Neither were a character I could pull for. Poppy’s character was fairly well developed, but Alex’s character needed more development. I would like to have seen chapters from Alex’s POV to further know his thinking. A minor quibble is the overt drug use detailed in the book. I didn’t feel it was necessary and took away from the story Henry was trying to tell. Also the gay characters seemed forced into the plot just so the book could be LGBTQ friendly, but again, they could have been omitted and it been just as good of a story. The ending felt rushed. Henry did a decent job of showing us the scenery, characters, and the action, until the end. She switched to a more narrative telling of the details to finish the book sooner. If she needed to cut material, there was plenty she could have cut and made more room to improve the ending. I cannot recommend this book as it was disappointing.

Alex is meant to be a serious, stable, but smoldering-hot brooding type.Epic fail: instead, Poppy comes across more like the attention-grabbing toddler your third cousin brought to the wedding even though she was told kids weren't allowed and who spilled her juice box on the bride's dress. Before the ceremony. And Alex is a mind-numbingly boring, condescending prat. You will find yourself rooting for them to get together, but only so they take each other out of the dating pool with the least amount of collateral damage.

In doing so, I found out that missing large sections leaves the reader with the exact same information as they had prior to making such a literary faux pas.

The main character is boring and dry. I stopped reading this book for almost a year because when I initially started, I hit page 5 where the main character talks about realizing she wanted to be a corporate lawyer at the age of 5 after a trip to the restaurant Serendipity with her father. That alone made me roll my eyes and set it down. When I picked it back up, I was let down. The main character never develops any emotional depth. I felt zero empathy for her or her situation. She remains dry and a type A personality throughout the whole thing. And SPOILER ALTERT: when her friend dies, it’s hard to feel anything for her because you never get their relationship. They have the over played trope of “serious best friend and carefree best friend” and I’m just done with it. The ending is a let down too. Nothing truly monumental happens in this book despite our main character experiencing the lose of her best friend.

She puts her work before her friend or her fiancé and then laments when her life when she starts feeling guilty. She criticizes her friends parents for not being there but travels the country putting herself and work first while her friend undergoes extensive treatment. The premise that her dying best friend would design and contract an expensive apartment loft for her while she was undergoing intensive cancer treatments for an aggressive cancer is utterly preposterous if you have ever walked the miserable journey with a loved one.

Mocking a 30 year travesty of stealing, abusing, selling, and in some cases murdering children - into a ridiculous story, a dumb story that shows no respect for the truth of the emotional pain and trauma these families and children truthfully endured is disrespectful to what they went through, to the lives lost. It is guaranteed that being a lawyer, running for political office, and finding love were all entitled luxuries none of the stolen and abused children or grieving parents considered - parents grieved for their children the rest of their lives; the children who remembered being taken yearned for their siblings and parents all their lives.

1250316774,1.0,"Eins der schlechtesten Bücher, das ich je gelesen habe.",32.0,"Auch Kitschromane haben ihre Berechtigung, es muss nicht immer Tolstoi sein. Aber auch Kitschgeschichten können gut geschrieben sein mit Liebe zum Detail und zu ihren Charakteren. Das ist hier nicht der Fall. 1. Das Buch ist schlecht recherchiert. Es finden sich mehrere Sachfehler, so hat England zB. keinen Premierminister, es gibt nur einen britischen Premierminister. Henry ist der zweitgeborene Sohn, trägt aber im Buch den Titel Prince of Wales, obwohl dieser nur dem Erstgeborenen und damit Thronfolger zusteht. 2. Ein guter Autor charakterisiert seine Personen durch deren Handlungen, nicht dadurch, dass der Autor sie einfach platt beschreibt. Hier verwickelt sich die Autorin darüber hinaus in Widersprüche: Zum einen soll Alex ein intelligenter, gutaussehender Publikumsliebling sein, von allen geliebt und verehrt, gleichzeitig hat er aber im Grunde keine Freunde und seine Handlungen zeigen ihn als unverbesserlich selbstverliebten, egozentrischen und arroganten Menschen. Alex gibt sich als Demokrat und Held der Armen, dem das Wohl der Unterdrückten so sehr am Herzen liegt, schmeißt aber zugleich Steuergelder mit vollen Händen zum Fenster raus bsw. für Interkontinentalflüge und hat einen Hang zum Luxus. 3. Die Autorin gesteht ihren Charakteren und der Geschichte kein Eigenleben zu. Alle Personen spiegeln zu 100% die Einstellungen und Stereotypen der Autorin wider. Ausnahme sind die Antagonisten, also Republikaner und die Königsfamilie. Die Republikaner lässt die Autorin gar nicht erst zu Wort kommen, die Königsfamilie darf zumindest auf den letzten Seiten endlich selbst einmal das Wort ergreifen. Aber auch hier kommen nur Plattitüden, die Autorin gesteht den Antagonisten nicht zu, dass auch deren Position legitim sein könnte und dass es unter Umständen auch andere berechtigte Perspektiven gibt als die der Hauptcharaktere. Die Charaktere bleiben wandelnde Vorurteile. So ist die Königin eine alte, ultrakonservative und unbelehrbare Herrin ohne jedes warme Gefühl für ihre Familie. 4. Doch auch die Helden der Geschichte bleiben flache Stereotype. Alex bsw. ist ein wahres Wunderkind, der mit seinen 20 oder so Jahren bereits an der Wahlkampagne der US-Präsidentin mitarbeitet (ohne abgeschlossenes Studium versteht sich) und mit noch jüngeren Jahren bereits bei Ausstellungen im Smithsonian Museum mitarbeitet. Der Leser wäre nicht überrascht, hätte die Autorin uns wissen lassen, dass Alex nebenher erfolgreich an einem Heilmittel für AIDS forscht und in seiner Freizeit den Nahostkonflikt löst. 5. Die Autorin schreibt über die Königsfamilie, aber warum eigentlich dieses Thema? Sie macht überaus deutlich, dass sie in der britischen Monarchie nur Imperialismus, Ausbeutung, Inzest, Rassismus und Unterdrückung sieht. Womit wir wieder bei den Vorurteilen wären. Fazit: Die Autorin hat ihre eigene sehr linke und schablonenhafte politische Weltsicht in ein Buch gegossen. Ich konnte damit gar nichts anfangen. Die Charaktere sind flach, die Handlung absolut vorhersehbar und die Entladung an böswilligen Klischees so erdrückend, dass es einfach keinen Spaß macht. Die Autorin sollte lernen, dass die Charaktere in ihren Büchern kein Ventil für ihre eigene Person und Einstellungen sind, sondern eigenständige Schöpfungen sein sollten. Die Welt ist nicht schwarz-weiß, in diesem Buch allerdings schon. Der kleine Kosmos dieses Buches ist klar in Gut und Böse eingeteilt: Ist man Demokrat, Migrant und links, dann ist man gut, alles wird einem verziehen, man ist der strahlende Sieger. Ist man allerdings Republikaner oder Adliger oder konservativ, dann steht man auf der dunklen Seite, ist abgrundtief böse und muss besiegt werden! Nein, danke. Es geht auch besser.",TRUE,children

The book reads like a bad prime-time sitcom. It might be fun to watch --- but I gave up at 20 percent through. I tried skimming and still gave up. It is an odd sensation that the book is written as though the characters all suffer from ADD.

1250316774,1.0,Terrible read.,5.0,"I really did not like this book at all. I knew it wasn't for me within a few chapters, but it was part of my book club so I continued on. That was disappointing because I'd really been looking forward to reading a romance (not a genre I tend to read) with non-hetero characters. Perhaps The Song of Achilles spoiled me, since I had read that one maybe a month prior? For my taste, there was far too much sex and not enough character development, or relationship development between those characters. Alex, the main character, is simply annoying as hell. He acts like a child in some instances (begging for the turkeys to be put in his room), then is always snarky or sarcastic in others (for instance, when he shortly thereafter asks the vet if the turkeys are bloodthirsty), like he's always ""on""... it makes it hard to get to know a character--or a person--if they're always showing you what they want the world to see, instead of who they are. But Alex simply isn't a nice person. He dislikes Harry for... a perceived slight at an event which took place shortly after Harry's father died, which of course Alex knew about? He calls England a ""garbage country"" because of the food they have for breakfast? He uses gendered slang as a put-down (""douchey""), and refuses to apologize once he realizes he's judged Harry unfairly. And he thinks about using his mom's position (aka, his privilege) to get him into the law school of his choice, rather than apply and be accepted on his merit? All of this just doesn't square with the supposed high ideals and forward-thinking nature we're supposed to believe Alex has, who wants to do the right thing simply because it's the right thing, when he is constantly judging people and ridicule that which he doesn't understand. The other thing that bothered me was Alex's political ancestry. I couldn't really suspend my disbelief enough to believe that Alex would have two parents in Congress, in two very different states (Texas and California); that his mother would be able to rise from a being at most a representative when Alex was born to President within 18 years; and that his father could move from Texas to California and have the political backing to be able to successfully mount a Congressional campaign when there would already have been an undoubtedly active and well-oiled political scene there. I know that some people have multiple family members in Congress (hello, Kennedys) but two parents? And this isn't one of those situations when a Congressperson retires or dies and their spouse then runs for the seat. No, this isn't something I can believe. Lastly, as I said earlier, way too much sex. Perhaps the biggest problem with the way too much sex is that it simply didn't seem to advance the plot; it was just there to be there and remind us that these are two gay men who feel they have to keep it secret for their family's sakes. I simply cannot believe that they fell in love through a few text messages and random hook-up sessions. The relationship didn't grow very organically; lust, I can absolutely believe, but if I'm supposed to believe these two fell love, there wasn't much here to show me that. We barely even see them in the same room but for when they're having sex, and the text messaging stuff left little to be desired. Overall, a disappointing main character (I may have been more interested in Harry's POV), mostly vapid side characters (Nora in particular), and little development of anyone makes this a book I was glad to put behind me.",TRUE,children

1250316774,1.0,Das Buch fängt gut an.das wars dann aber auch schon.,1.0,"- Die Charaktere sind flach und stereotyp. Der Hauptcharakter ist sehr gewöhnungsbedürftig und eher unsympathisch - Teilweise ist das Buch sehr langatmig - Das was als Liebe bezeichnet wird, wirkt schnell wie sexuelle Begierde - Das Buch ist getränkt von einer anti-Groß Britannien Haltung. (Selbst die Briten sind irgendwie antibritisch, zumindest die ""Guten"" ) - Die Autorin hat nicht vernünftig recherchiert, sondern einfach nur ihre Vorurteile unreflektiert niedergeschrieben und zu allem Überfluss, lässt sie auch noch alle zwei Sekunden ihre politische Meinung durchblicken, die ich ihr, angesichts ihrer Äußerungen zu England, beim besten willen nicht abkaufen kann. Wer es ausführlicher möchte: Die Handlung ist ziemlich 0815. Zwei Typen verlieben sich nachdem sie bemerken, dass der andere gar nicht so schlimm ist wie angenommen und um die ganze Sache ein bisschen interessanter zu machen, handelt es sich bei den beiden um einen Präsidentensohn und einen britischen Prinzen (auch nichts neues). An sich muss das ja aber nicht heißen, dass ein Buch deshalb schlecht seien muss. Und dieses Buch hätte durchaus Potential gehabt. Selbst der unglaublich kindische, arrogante und ich-bezogene Hauptcharakter hätte evtl. Potential haben können, wäre er denn mit der Handlung gewachsen und hätte die Autorin auf seine unausstehliche Boston-Tea-Party Mentalität verzichtet. Durch seine Art alles britische und royale ins lächerliche zu ziehen, wirkt er nicht wie der gebildete Demokrat, den uns die Autorin so ausführlich beschreibt, sondern wie ein plumper Redneck. Auch der Prinz hat am Anfang noch Potenzial, geht aber nach näherer Ausführung des Charakters, nicht mehr wirklich als Brite durch. Seine Mutter noch weniger. Allgemein geht kein britischer Charakter in diesem Buch, als Brite durch und schon gar nicht als Royal. Vor allem die Queen ist völlig überzogen und stumpfsinnig. Sie wirkt wie eine europäische Stereotype aus amerikanischer Sicht. Die amerikanischen Charaktere sind auch nicht gerade eine Meisterleistung. Vielmehr scheinen sie alle, ein und denselben Charakter zu haben. Sowohl britische als auch amerikanische Figuren wirken in diesem Buch, als hätten sie nur die Aufgabe uns davon zu überzeugen, dass die Monarchie veraltet ja gar ""böse"" ist, während der Hauptcharakter einem immer wieder lange Monologe über Toleranz hält. Um noch eins obendrauf zu setzen, werden uns alle Figuren als wahre Genies vorgestellt, was aber in keinerlei weise aus ihren Handlungen hervorgeht. Die pubertäre Vulgärsprache mancher, heimst auch keine Sympathiepunkte ein, eher im Gegenteil. Insgesamt verhalten sich die beiden Hauptcharaktere wie sex besessene Teenis und nicht wie Männer im Alter von 20/23 Jahren. Das sie während ihrer stell dich eins auch immer betrunken sind, macht die Romanze noch unrealistischer. Die langen, völlig irrelevanten und fragwürdigen Phrasen über die amerikanische Politik, sollen wohl davon ablenken, dass die Autorin nicht vernünftig recherchiert hat. Der Stuss, den sie über die britische Seite schreibt, wurde eindeutig aus Halbwissen, ein paar dürftigen Internetrecherchen und Vorurteilen lieblos zusammengekleistert.

Yeah, right. He is a really insightful young man. IMO, in general it is not a good idea for women to try to write about sexual experiences from a male point of view, nor is it particularly effective for men to try to write from a female perspective.

Add in the pervasive racism i.e the constant references to ‘WASPy’ Hunter, Alex’s creepy desire to punch handsome white men and the the stale ‘old white guy’ troupes and it becomes clear that the execution of this story is deeply flawed. The writers mindset ranges from a 9 year-old enthralled with the fantasy of the Disney’s-esque “Prince Charming” fantasy to a self-loathing partisan overlaying an immature, presumptuous world-view swaddled in her leftist politics that she smears liberally across her flat characters like a bitter marmalade. In summary: a cute storyline ‘written’ from the POV of male gay and bi characters by a woman in a structure hostile to white men while making a white man the focus of the protagonists desire.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking fan fiction...ask E.L. James how far fan fiction can get you in life. And I'm not ashamed to admit- I have read some fan fiction that is positively mind blowing. So good, it sticks in your brain and tries to become canon. This is not it. This is on the same intellectual level as the 50 Shades trilogy. It's fun, mindless reading- as far as the romance parts go. The character development was mind-numbing. Every character had to be ""soooo edgy."" Addiction and gender non-conformity and transgender ninja style Secret Service members and pansexual cuddle puddles all over. I guess to a certain extent- this is just how most young people are now...everything is totally performative and ""THIS IS MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE."" It just felt so false to me within the lines of the book- like the author was trying to check off every single box on the ""Well Rounded 21st Century Character Development List."" The characters came off really annoying because of it. There was a lot of really unrealistic points about the Royal Family, as well. Pez and Henry's friendship stuck out to me the most. No chance in HELL would a royal ever get away with having a friend that acted and presented himself like that. Once again, I get that this is some 20-something fantasy of how she wishes the world could be- but details like that took the book's plot over the top into ridiculousness territory. On that note...the evil, predatory Republican. Dude. COME ON. With all of the #saveourchildren stuff going on right now, and many, many famous liberal American faces being implicated in it- this just felt like straight up politically skewered nonsense. There's plenty of scumbags on both sides of the party line in America. I get the point the author is trying to make. What better foil for the virtuous, hardworking, biracial First Family than an evil, predatory white man character? I'm old enough to know that if that is how you see America, no one is going to change your opinion. The author's political stance is transparent in this. If you can overlook the partisan approach to life navigation, and you don't mind a parade of characters that are one-dimensional, fantasy versions of what you see 14 year olds fantasizing about on the LGBTQIA+ pages of Tumblr, then this is a fun little romance story. I think I'm just too old to appreciate the shallowness of the plotline and characters.",FALSE,children
1250316774,1.0,Overhyped and Mean-Spirited (politically),465.0,"Okay, don’t hate me for this, because my review is certainly in the minority when it comes to this book; I simply couldn’t make up my mind: one star? Two stars? Three stars? Oftentimes, I was annoyed by it— the biased politics— more than that, perpetually frustrated about all the lovey-dovey stuff and incessant faire l'amour (it was excessive!!). Then again, there were moments that really struck me deep, and Lord knows I’m an emotional reader. One key scene towards the end made me tear up a bit, and it’s not often that happens. So, kudos for that. I know this book is going to be a big hit for many people, and I’m fully prepared to defend my unpopular opinion from here on out. Let me say this: it was very clear from the beginning how this story was going to end. It wasn’t surprising... like, at all! But, the joy should be in the journey no matter the outcome, right? Well... no. It was written nicely at times (but mostly it’s a very tumblr/fanfic/glib mess). There were many moments of inspired, descriptive passages and pretty prose, sure, but... It’s a shame that you had to trudge through the too-frequent, unrealistically crude, sarcastic banter to get to it, though, so... Almost every side character is a person of color, and there’s lots of lgbtq representation, which should feel great, but instead comes off as incredibly forced (which is not so great)— like a diversity checklist. The inclusion of multiple POC I perceived as only to be used as a statement, which feels wrong somehow. I dig that here the First Family is biracial, but again, it didn’t feel organic (couldn’t it just be, “This is us. This is who we are” and leave it at that? Instead of it trying to hammer home social commentary?). It’s totally all contrived political correctness. The rep is important: we have multiple LGBTQIA+ caricatures, that came off as disingenuous stereotypes. But mostly, for the entirety of the novel, I couldn’t connect with the MCs. They didn’t feel real enough: too smug, snarky, narcissistic, and the romance was all-consuming (and I hate that)... Give me diversity and representation, but let it make sense! Let it be real!!! A lot happens in the first 10% of the book (it felt like it was crammed in, or one giant prologue that’s multiple chapters long): White House to London, back to USA, then London again, a wedding and three public events— I didn’t know how it was going to be dragged out for the remaining 90%. I wish more time was actually focused on a few of Alex and Henry’s outings earlier on, because they came and went so fast I got whiplash: the trip to the stables was over in a blink, the talk show (I think it was?) was probably a paragraph or two before it jumped abruptly into a charity event. There was SO MUCH room for elaboration... these were missed opportunities for interesting depth progression, and could’ve saved on so much unnecessarily long-winded ramblings later on. After about a third of the way through, the books starts to evolve into something different— more sincere, if you will. Making the first 30-odd percent seem like an infinitely different story/tone. (Side note: the whole ‘young adults debate Star Wars’ schtick is SO overdone). There is a huge identity crisis happening in this novel: sometimes it screams YA, and then other times characters are talking about graphic acts. Fair warning for anyone sensitive to it: there is extremely frequent crude/crass language, and lots of sexual material. One of the more ""intimate"" scenes plays out for like, several pages (too long, in my opinion). We get a dozen (I am not exaggerating!) different sex scenes. Now, I’m no prude (and wholly sex positive), but that’s just TOO MANY! It read like fanfiction-y smut. I also can’t believe I’m saying this, but there was just waaaay too much banter for my liking. It was all “sharp” millennial humor all the dang time. I craved moments of actual sarcasm-less depth and seriousness, and was frequently disappointed most of the way through, which was often, because this book is OVERLONG! I was constantly checking my progress, because the story just dragsssss and I wanted it to pick up the pace. (Not to sound nit-picky, but...)— cool. Another politically-charged book out to vilify Republicans. I get it: it’s AU liberal wish fulfillment about the First Family. They’re Democrats. I’m fine with that, obviously, because I don’t judge people or outright reject anyone based on political affiliation. But couldn’t this book just leave out all the name calling, ignorance, and horrible right-wing stereotyping? The only message I see being pushed here is that Republicans are nothing more than bigoted, racist, fascist, evil, homophobic sexual predators, and Democrats are the ones to save us all. The authoress could’ve done the decent thing: play nice and not be so severely partisan (being pro-bipartisan won’t make you any less progressive), but that’s too much to ask with such clearly imbedded bias. Her disgust for Republicans is scary and, frankly really, really sad.

We are reminded many times in case we thought he was gay! I'm not undermining the existence of bisexuality, but there's no elaboration on this. Shagging a few girls in your teens doesn't automatically make you bi, so it's hard to believe that he's actually into girls. The author is doing a disservice by not diving deeper into the psyche of a bi sexual man. The author does not show us what it's like to be bisexual so we can conclude (poorly) that bisexuality is just about having more options in the dating pool. Just as some British readers have noted the lack of research on the monarchy, I feel the same about Texas. This could've been a fantastic book to highlight life in Texas as a queer person, but instead it seems like the author just Googled most popular places in Austin and slapped the names down on paper.

If you know what I'm talking about...RUN. It probably goes without saying that I was unable to finish this. I was absolutely exhausted with the sheer overwhelming *cringe* of it soon after Alex and Henry started their relationship which is in the first 25% of the book. After that the building, enemies to lovers romance (which was the only interesting, compelling part) falls incredibly flat, whatever tension simmered between the two men before simply burns out in a sad puff of very mediocre, juvenile smoke. It simply isn’t a compelling romance, even though it’s between a Prince and President’s son and it should all be very exciting. The sex scenes are...meh, okay? Not exactly titillating, quite the opposite really if you've ever read a sex scene in your life, but they’re there...sort of, if that helps? The goal might have been to avoid the explicit, but the result was a weird disconnect leaving me a bit confused about what had actually physically happened and the passion between them fizzled out in the text. There’s also a LOT of dragging on and on about American politics, which is a bit of a snooze. However, the biggest flaw is that most of the characters have the exact same personality and voice, and that voice is Tumblr circa 2016. It’s all very sassy, we’re so fabulous, ‘omg you didn’t know you were gay, is this something we’re pretending we didn’t know hunny yaaas lol’. It's so embarrassing, it's like a teenager binge watched Gilmore Girls, sat on TikTok for five hours then tried to turn it into a novel. It’s very grating very quickly. The saddest part is you could switch any of the characters out for another and I really wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. Nora, June, Alex, Amy, Zahra, Luna, even Liam (who is in it for one conversation). They are all the exact same person, even though the author tries very hard to tell us that they are different, really...like this one is brainy...that one is smart...this one is clever. It's all just different ways of describing The Same Person. The only ones with different personalities are Henry and Pez (posh and sad, or extravagant dandy, respectively). The author also suffers terribly from over-explaining the characters. Instead of showing me someone is X, Y or Z through their actions or words I am told it by the main character, who constantly narrates their traits, history and their relationship with other characters through the years all in one giant paragraph. Not to mention the traits and descriptions I was given of these characters didn’t always make sense with their actions. So why bother? It's SUCH a bummer the characters and dialogue is so awful because the author is capable of some really lovely prose descriptions, I found myself going back more than once to re-read a sentence just to really see, and experience the emotion behind it.

1250316774,1.0,Expected much more…,2.0,"Because of so many positive reviews I decided to give this book a try. I was very excited to learn the protagonist was of Mexican origin 😍. Well that excitement didn’t last long. Honestly, to me, the book started off really well but then jumped into numerous cliches, VERY long/unnecessary/wordy details, and terrible dialogue. I guess I didn’t expect it to be written in a tumblr/fanfic/Wattpad fashion and tone. Keep in mind this all comes from only getting through the book’s halfway point because I don’t see myself continuing to see if it gets better. Until this point, the only chapter I fell in love with involved a turkey 🦃. I just expected more from this book, or better yet had different expectations. If you enjoyed it, GREAT! Sadly it’s not for me, and I really wanted to like it.",TRUE,children
1250316774,1.0,Boring Romance,,I'm baffled by the positive reviews. This read like fanfiction to me with uneven action and choppy dialogue. I couldn't finish this one.,FALSE,children
1250316774,1.0,Shallow politically and the thematically,2.0,"I was excited to finally read this but found it a big let down. As other reviewers have noted, the pacing is very uneven so that the first third of the book was entertaining but it in the middle the characters and their relationship reached a plateau. My biggest criticism of this book though is the shallow and hateful depiction of republicans. I understand that the book is about the president’s son so of course some politics will be involved, but it is difficult to get through a book when it is clear the author has total contempt for you and your beliefs. At first I ignored it, having expected the republicans to be the villains, but as the story slowed and the characters showed no depth or growth, I found that inuring myself to the contumely was no longer warranted. A disappointment.",FALSE,children
