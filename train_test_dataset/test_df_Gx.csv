23710,399562494,1,Seems like a plagiarism of The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek,11,"How can I give even one star for Jojo Moyes book, The Giver of Stars, when I feel it‚Äôs so similar to Michele Richardson‚Äôs The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek, it simply feels like plagiarism. It is upsetting to think Moyes, a popular well known British writer, would take the work of a lesser known American writer and claim so much of it as her own. Apparently, Moyes denies ever reading Richardson‚Äôs book. I have just read both books. If you read both, you will likely agree with me . Moyes lives in London and in the 9 month period when she was writing her book she spent time in Kentucky. Richardson, born in Kentucky, spent 4 years researching the Book Women of the 1930's. If you are interested in the historical period, the dialog and setting descriptions, they are far more accurate in Richardson‚Äôs book. I was born in Evansville near the Kentucky border. My mother and grandparents farmed in rural Indiana. Books were treasures. Wood was carried in to heat the house. Quilt patterns, recipes, and cures for ailments were pasted in used ledgers. Richardson‚Äôs book brought back the stories so often told of freezing winds, long walks to the nearest town and the birth of my mother declared still born until they took her to the outside pump and pumped water on her. Moyes used some of the same descriptions of the rural Kentucky used by Richardson, but her characters though likable are hard to believe. Especially Alice who left her tea party life in England, married a Kentucky man and became a Book Woman. In contrast, Richardson‚Äôs characters especially, Cussy Mary and her mule are likable and tough. They are fictional characters but they seem very real to the time and place. Moyes seems to be talented in writing about romance. Even though it appears she has plagiarized Richardson‚Äôs book, her account of the Book Women in Kentucky is sadly lacking in authenticity.",FALSE,children,Language.ENGLISH,

I'm sorry, but he mostly annoyed me, his obsession with Alicia Berenson and his marriage problem. And, from the beginning is it clear that he's not that mentally sound so I wasn't surprised when ""things"" happened towards the end. I felt that the story was just idling along, it never picked up the pace and neither Alicia's diary entries nor Theo's POV really grabbed my interest. At least it was pleasant enough that I could finish the book. Now, of course, there must be some twist to the story and sure enough, when the book was nearly done did it show up. And, yes I have to admit that it was a clever move, alas a bit too late for me and frankly not especially imaginative. It felt a bit like it's been done before and I just felt a bit tired and not that impressed.

2221,1451673310,4,Passionate Defense of Ideas,One person found this helpful,"Many people have pointed out that this isn't a book about censorship but rather the negative effect that popular culture, and television in particular, have on society when entertainment and mindless fun are the only goals. Bradbury has stated this in numerous interviews but his book has struck a chord with those who vehemently oppose censorship for obvious reasons. Bradbury wrote the book during the McCarthy witch hunts and he also says in interviews that he was profoundly affected by images of Nazi's burning books. These things have found many echoes in the book. The question of what an author intends on a conscious level and what his or her writing evokes in a reader is a fascinating one and I don't think interpretations should be limited to what the author believes the book is about. Writing is a very subconscious process that even the author doesn't have control over and when a book is released into the world it becomes the readers to make meaning from.This book-lovers book is a compelling portrayal of a dystopian society. Unlike many books in this genre, a tyrannical government has not set out to brainwash people and take control. Instead people have gradually drifted away from intellectual pursuits like reading in favor of television and things that make them feel good, to the point that anything that raises hard questions or reminds people of the harsher aspects of life is banned, and in the case of books, burned. All of this is outlined most succinctly in Captain Beatty's monologue: ""It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade journals.""The rants about minority interest groups being partly responsible for this dumbing-down of culture is controversial and Bradbury seems to be taking a shot at ""political correctness"" (a term which hadn't even been coined then). I think what he is getting at here is the tendency to stifle anything unpleasant or disagreeable and pretend it doesn't exist instead of shining a light on it. The portrayal of all of popular culture as degenerate is obviously a gross exaggeration but there is so much in this book that is relevant today and that's why it still resonates so strongly. Our TVs get bigger every year and will soon be the size of walls while news has  been reduced to sound-bytes and entertainment pieces and we spend hours online each day filling our brains with the mental equivalent of candy-floss. The whole spectacle of Montag's pursuit by the police and the ""scapegoat"" who was found to bring closure for the audience is very pertinent.Ultimately for me this book is a passionate defense of the power of ideas to change the world for the better. The portrayal of people memorising books to pass these ideas onto future generations, even as the world goes to hell around them, is so poignant. Bradbury even touches on environmental devastation: ""When we forget how close the wilderness is in the night, my grandpa said, some day it will come in and get us, for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it can be.""This quote from Granger, one of the memory-keepers, best sums up what Fahrenheit 451 is about: ""We're remembering. That's where we'll win out in the long run. And some day we'll remember so much that we'll build the biggest goddam steam-shovel in history and the dig the biggest grave of all time and shove war in and cover it up.""Amen to that.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,

16774,1984806734,4,4 Stars - Really good,9 people found this helpful,"I just wasn't sure about this one when I requested it. The cover is that stinking animated trend that I really dislike. I don't always read adult books due to potential content, but I've learned that just because a book is labeled adult doesn't mean it has to include graphic content. I'm not familiar with this author (although I am interested in looking into her other books). But the description had a few things going for it that pulled me in. I loved that both main characters are authors, and I also liked their bet/challenge about stepping out of their normal genres to write something different.January is disillusioned. Her father recently passed away, and on the day of his funeral she found out that he'd had an affair while her mother was fighting cancer. And her long-term boyfriend couldn't handle her journey through grief and betrayal. Struggling with writing anything romance-driven, she's in a financial bind as well. So January moves temporarily into her father's lake house to empty it and sell it...while also writing a book.January quickly realizes that her next-door neighbor is Gus Everett who she went to college with. Back then, Gus repeatedly criticized her writing because of her perpetual happy endings. He also chose to only critique her during class which caused a lot of resentment. Yet there's always another side to the story.I loved the insight we're given into the writing and even briefly into the publishing process. This isn't too detailed. It didn't take over the story, but I think Emily Henry included just the right amount of both the story January was writing and the process itself.Gus was endearing. He's awkward. He sees the world in a darker way than January does. Yet he's drawn to her light. There was not much that I didn't like about Gus.I don't always address this because I feel like I would be repeating myself in 90% of my reviews, but there were certainly many moral decisions in this book that I don't personally support. My thoughts on many of these things the majority of our country would consider outdated, but that doesn't change the fact that I hold to a different moral standard than the average American (or so it seems these days).Favorite quotes:-It wasn‚Äôt that I couldn‚Äôt get enough of him. Or that he was the best man I‚Äôd ever known. (I‚Äôd thought that was my dad, but now it was the dad from my favorite 2000s teen drama, Veronica Mars.) Or that he was my favorite person. (That was Shadi.) Or because he made me laugh so hard I wept. (He laughed easily, but rarely joked.) Or that when something bad happened, he was the first person I wanted to call. (He wasn‚Äôt.) It was that we met at the same age my parents had, that the snowball fight and impromptu road trip had felt like fate, that my mother adored him. He fit so perfectly into the love story I‚Äôd imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life.-Anger with all the broken parents, heartache that they too must‚Äôve felt like kids‚Äîhelpless, unsure how to make the right decisions, terrified of making the wrong ones.-‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe in any kind of internal moral compass.‚Äù The way he said it made it seem as if he himself did believe in such a thing, which would‚Äôve surprised me a few weeks ago, but now made perfect sense. ‚ÄúMaybe you start out with that,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúBut if you do, it gets shaped as you age. How are you supposed to believe right‚Äôs right and wrong‚Äôs wrong if everyone around you says the opposite? You‚Äôre supposed to think you‚Äôre smarter than all of them?‚Äù-‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know the difference between pity and sympathy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not pitying you. It makes me sad to think of you being treated like that. It makes me mad to think you didn‚Äôt have the things all kids deserve. And yeah, it makes me mad and sad that a lot of people go through the things you went through, but it‚Äôs even more upsetting because it‚Äôs you. And I know you and I like you and I want you to have a good life. That‚Äôs not pity. That‚Äôs caring about someone.‚Äù-You make beautiful things, because you love the world, and maybe the world doesn‚Äôt always look how it does in your books, but ‚Ä¶ I think putting them out there, that changes the world a little bit. And the world can‚Äôt afford to lose that.‚ÄùThese quotes remind me of a few things I want to mention. The second quote is a reminder that I now read from a parental figure's point of view just as much as the main character. I can't turn it off. The third reminds me that I can't base what I believe to be right or wrong upon myself or anyone else or even a large collection of others. God's Word will always be my moral compass. I have and will fall short. But I at least have a guide that does not waver. The fourth is a pet peeve of mine. Characters in books often disdain what they perceive as pity, but sympathy is usually what's being extended to them by people who care. And those people don't have to be in their close inner circle to care. For the last quote, I fancy seeing myself writing a book one day. And if I ever do, I hope that my characters or my world might not be realistic so much as hopeful or portrayals of what can be.Beach Read was much better than I expected it to be. I really enjoyed the process of the relationship between Gus and January. I appreciated her journey through grief and beginning to heal. I also liked the information surrounding writing, the process, and the publishing side we get to see.

15042,1984806734,4,"Feel good book with romance, funny banter & heartfelt moments",2 people found this helpful,"4.5‚≠êÔ∏è/2üå∂A story revolving around two writers, each writing in specific genres from romance and literary fiction. January and Augustus couldn‚Äôt be any more different (aside from attending the same university where they were classmates). January believed in happily ever afters, whereas Augustus was more focused on creating intricate storylines. Each had their own style and ideas when it came to their writing, but‚Ä¶ through the unexpected encounter in North Bear Shore, their summer changed for the better.First off, this story heavily focused on January and Augustus‚Äôs writing careers and how they went about creating their stories. So fair warning, the beginning was a bit slow but as I got more into the story, it started to pick up in pace. Right off the bat, January went to North Bear Shores in order to get away and try to write her next novel. Among other personal reasons, January just needed to get away and have a clean start to get her mind off things, but also try to finish the novel she promised her publisher she would have ready. Along the way, SURPRISE! January‚Äôs old classmate/ her rival (at least to her) Augustus Everett. Augustus a.k.a. Gus happened to live in North Bear Shores, and guess what?‚Ä¶ HE LIVED RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO JANUARY!When I heard things about this book, I was told it had an ‚Äúenemies to lovers‚Äù, but honestly I felt like it was more of Augustus and January occasionally making playful jabs at each other, it was never malicious or hurtful. If anything there was more teasing and playful competition to see who‚Äôs book would end up being better. I found Augustus and January interesting, funny, sweet, thoughtful, and overall they had a good connection to each other.Now‚Ä¶ while I liked Augustus, I wouldn‚Äôt say he was ‚Äúbest book boyfriend‚Äù, he had some qualities to him that I liked, but I still feel like I‚Äôm more of a Alex Nilsen type of gal. I feel bad because as much as I was anticipating reading and learning about Augustus, I felt like people overhyped him for me, and I feel bad that my expectations weren‚Äôt met as I had hoped. That being said, I still did like Augustus, and loved the connection he shared with January. Augustus was more of the intellectual, reserved, slightly grumpy at times, and endearing. If I had to choose between Emily Henry‚Äôs male characters of Augustus and Alex‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going with Alex (don‚Äôt hate me!)One of the things I enjoyed from the story was how book centered it was. What I mean is, this story was not only about love, family, and the harsh realities of life, but also how books can bring people together. There was a specific quote that stood out to me that encapsulated the feeling I get whenever I read, and it was, ‚ÄúThat feeling of falling head over heels in love with a story and it‚Äôs characters‚Ä¶‚Äù I loved that Emily Henry included that small quote because it spoke volumes to me, and it was like, ‚ÄúYES I KNOW THAT EXACT FEELING YOU‚ÄôRE TALKING ABOUT!‚Äù My fellow book lovers will understand and love this quote.Overall, this was a sweet, funny, heartfelt/ a bit emotional story that was good. I liked January and Augustus‚Äôs relationship and especially loved their banter, even when they were tearing off each other‚Äôs clothes January still managed to roast Augustus haha. If you love stories centered around people who love books, writers as the main characters, funny, romantic, little bit of spice, and overall a feel good book, then you should check out this story.",TRUE,romance,Language.ENGLISH,

The replacement book seems to be defect free.  5 people in my group also have players guides, and their guides seem to be in good quality.My groups history is we played 3.5, many of us bought the core books for 4th, and decided not to play it.  We played 3.5 ever since.Book quality - 3 stars and falling as fast as the pages fall out.  To start, some pages were attached along the bottoms, but this was easily remedied.  I have had the book for 2 weeks, and have never seen a DnD book deteriorate this quickly.  First, The glue holding the pages had started to separate from the top of the spine. The first and last 50 pages are still attached to the binding, but the center 200 bow away from the binding when the book is opened.  Now that the pages are separating from the binding, they are starting to split apart towards the center of the book (Backgrounds chapter).  I can now see the cover binding between the splits opening up between pages.  At this rate, the book will have split into 2 parts in the next week, held together only by the outer cover. Once that happens, its only a short matter of time till the center pages start falling out in clumps as the glue breaks from simple page turning.Game system - I would give it a 5.  Not a perfect system, but solid.PRO - i think it is a big improvement in many areas that needed it.  I usually have a larger than normal group of players, so keeping things moving on players turns could be tough.  It sucks when one round of combat takes way longer than it should.  this system also seems to have removed much of the overpowered min/maxing.  With the different paths for each class, I like the diversity it added without requiring complex level / feat combinations for prestige classes.CONs-Many character choices are generated in the first few levels, with little room for adaptation later on as your character grows (unless you are a spell caster).  Example: a fighter selects skills for 1-hander and shield skills, then finds a great 2-hander.  There are too few options available to switch to a 2-handed build.-The majority of saving throws still tend to focus on Dex, Con or Wis.-would have liked to see casters get their primary stat added to cantrip damage across the board.  Many damage Cantrips just feel under powered compared to attacking with a weapon until the caster hits level 5.-Damage breaks Concentration - Some defensive spells, like Shield of Faith, seem negligible when you consider any damage triggers a near 50-50 shot the spell will end unless you have a really good Con.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,

13613,1542046599,3,Badly paced thriller with some interesting characters,7 people found this helpful,"I passed on this book when it was first available through ‚ÄúAmazon first reads‚Äù program but later on, after seeing its high ratings, I decided to read it. In contrast to the majority of reviewers I was not impressed. Here is why.According to the author herself one of the points of this story was to show how the crime affects not only those directly involved but also many others. This idea led to rather boring repetitions when the same events are described several times from the point of view of different protagonists. This was especially annoying in the second half of the book.The main protagonist, Ella, is ridden by guilt for not trying to contact the parents of two young girls that she saw becoming too friendly with two male convicts freshly released from prison. But her whole idea of intervention is quite ridiculous. Good luck with wrestling a cell phone and parents‚Äô phone numbers from 16 years old girls flirting with young men.  Also later in the book the Ella character seemed to me not mature, not very smart nor responsible and tending to indulge in self-centered dramas; I just did not like her.There were many other annoying parts in this book (like reoccurring phrase ‚Äúyou disgust me‚Äù) and pacing was all wrong but there were also many interesting characters that kept me reading. It is not the best psychological thriller I read but it is good enough to deserve solid 3 stars, especially because it is a debut book.",TRUE,mystery,Language.ENGLISH,

However, I noticed he hadn't picked it up since the first time he looked it over and was reading other books.  I said what's wrong.. you wanted that for Christmas?  He said the lettering is small ( meaning there were more words on the page than he thought) - He was intimidated a little. I encourage him to pick it back up that it was ok and he could do. He did and then .. not kidding,, no exaggeration... He read all Five books in 6 weeks.. about a half a million words.. He loved the content and it sucked him in.. No Going Back.  I was so impressed.

2869,B0176M3U10,5,ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL BOOKS OF 2016,5 people found this helpful,"HOLY WOW! It Ends With Us is one of the most powerful books of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I‚Äôve ever read. It wasn‚Äôt anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like‚Ä¶ READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It‚Äôs a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been prouder of a heroine. I‚Äôve loved Colleen Hoover‚Äôs books for a long time because she always writes unique stories‚Ä¶ and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completely spoiler-free review. I‚Äôm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It‚Äôs a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it‚Äôs amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I‚Äôm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I‚Äôve really learned to trust Colleen‚Äôs writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all‚Ä¶ and I was blown away by the story!This book is unputdownable. You‚Äôll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I didn‚Äôt finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I‚Äôve ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn‚Äôt be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I‚Äôd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been this proud of a fictional character before.There‚Äôs an incredibly powerful message in this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don‚Äôt yet realize how significant each of these moments truly are‚Ä¶ and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I‚Äôm not mentioning it on purpose because I don‚Äôt want you to expect it. The fact that it‚Äôs unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it‚Äôs also unexpected for the heroine. As she begins to realize what kind of situation she‚Äôs in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journey with her.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the ‚Äòlove triangle‚Äô because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don‚Äôt want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you‚Äôre thinking this book is, just trust me ‚Äî it‚Äôs so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I‚Äôm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time ‚Äî not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant ‚Äî and there‚Äôs this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such a strong impact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went ‚Äòwoah!‚Äô. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn‚Äôt possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make a seriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people ‚Äî whether they‚Äôve personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has ‚Äî so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don‚Äôt want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it to everyone!""That‚Äôs what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.It can save them.""Rating: 5+ STARS! Standalone.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,

20737,133821666X,1,EXTREMELY disappointing - contains spoilers.,10,"Huge Harry Potter nerd here. Simply seeing a piece of artwork involving Harry Potter can send me into tears. Met my husband in a Harry Potter chatroom. Have read all the books MULTIPLE times each, etc etc. I am a HUGE fan. J.K. Rowling has disappointed me a couple of times since the last book came out (mostly when she said Hermione and Ron should not have ended up together), but I will say this is the single biggest disappointment. I know she didn't write it - but the fact that she endorses it, and that I am to take it as canon, is frankly sickening. Time for me to get spoiler-y: ***********SPOILERS*********** The characters were SO OUT OF CHARACTER. I could believe Harry having struggles with fatherhood due to the fact that his was dead. However, telling Albus he wished he wasn't his son? No. Never. Those words would not come out of Harry's mouth, not matter how provoked. Rose being prejudiced towards Scorpius? ROSE WEASLEY, the spawn of Ron and Hermione? They would have taught her to NEVER judge based on house, I feel that she would never behave like that, shunning her own cousin just because he wanted to be friends with Scorpius. You're trying to tell me Draco Malfoy would be okay with his son befriending a Potter, and would have taught his son as much, but Hermione/Ron did not pass this along to Rose? Hermione was not her normal witty self, Ron did at least have some humorous moments - but Harry was just so off. Shunning family for work, telling Albus he couldn't be friends with Scorpius, his BEST FRIEND. That is something Harry would NEVER do. He knows the importance of friendship more than anyone! That is practically the whole point of the books. I just don't believe it. Don't get me started on Voldemort having a daughter... He was never the type to be interested in procreating. I guess I could look over this, maybe he wanted to pass on his name, WHATEVER, but the fact that she is just kept hidden for years, and reemerges as Amos Diggory's nurse... why wasn't Harry's scar hurting the whole time? Why did he just now start to feel her presence? Why on earth would she choose to save Cedric in order to save Voldemort?! There are so many other ways she could have done that, much CLEANER ways, that perhaps wouldn't spawn a million different alternate timelines. And the time turner.. not even freaking canon, although I guess now I am supposed to consider it canon - going back in time as much as you want apparently, not to mention all of the things that doing that would change, and the fact that some people even had problems with how the third book handled messing with time. WHY CHOOSE THAT AS A PLOT? It's so hard to believe even when done properly. There are INFINITE other possibilities (as many other, BETTER fan fictions have explored). They could have done such great things with the story of Harry's kids. Instead they did this. And Cedric becoming a death eater? Because he got humiliated at the triwizard tournament? HAS THE AUTHOR EVEN READ HARRY POTTER? Cedric was a purely GOOD human being, he would NEVER go to the dark side, especially over something so trivial. I don't even know if Cedric had the ability to feel humiliation, he was so confident in himself and his abilities. The fact that the entire plot of the book rests on him becoming a death eater like that is so ridiculous, it makes me sick to my stomach. He would've made a joke out of it and moved on, he didn't care if he won the tournament. I cannot believe this book was allowed to exist. There were a very few select moments that I did enjoy. The flash of Hagrid as he picked Harry up out from Godric's Hollow (but, then again, anything involving Hagrid makes me melt). The fact that Albus was sorted into Slytherin was great, and the fact that Scorpius had a crush on Rose was great as well. Hermione being Minister of magic has long been my head canon. I admit I did shed some tears when Harry watched his parent's die, but only because that's a sad moment from the actual books. I don't like that he was there to witness it, along with all his friends and Draco. He saw it in his dreams, that should've been enough. There were some funny moments, mostly from Ron or Scorpius, but other than that, I really find nothing redeemable. So, so disappointed.",TRUE,children,Language.ENGLISH,

It was exactly what I didn't want to read, exactly when I didn't want to read it, because there were too many parallels between real life and January's and Gus's lives. It ripped me apart and lovingly pieced me back together.January and Gus are fantastic. I couldn't get enough of either of them. Sure, January was frustrating at times because she could've had the answers she wanted if she got out of her own way for two seconds. And Gus was so hot and cold that it was hard to adjust from one moment to the next. But that's part of the charm here. They're very real, flawed characters. I'm friends with a January. I've dated a Gus. (I can be something of a Gus myself.) I felt like I got to know them in a more fundamental way and I appreciated it.The story moved at the perfect pace. I loved the writing aspect of it all; that was particularly pleasing. The whole thing worked in a way where I couldn't see the bones. I wasn't sitting there knowing what came next because of the traditional trajectory and what had come before. I was able to step back, step IN, and just enjoy it.

4974,399226907,5,This is One of My Twins' Favorite Books!,,"My three-year-old twins received this book as a gift when they were newborns and we read it several times a week before bedtime. They never get tired of it! We have a few of Eric Carle's books besides this one but The Very Hungry Caterpillar is our favorite. The book tells the story about how a little caterpillar pops out of an egg and he is very hungry so he eats...and eats...and eats! At first he starts by eating one apple on Monday, then two pears on Tuesday,and so on but it isn't enough so each day he eats more and more until his stomach hurts because he ate too much. I won't spoil the ending because it's extremely cute and fun for my twins to look at.We have the board book edition and it's held up extremely well over the past three years considering we are still on our first copy of it! The book measures seven inches by five inches and is a great size for small hands. There are 22 pages in the story which includes fun, beautiful pictures. Each set of pages has one or two sentences so it's a nice length for short attention spans. One thing that is really neat about this book is that since the caterpillar is eating through a number of foods, there are actual holes in the pages big enough for a finger so kids can have fun sticking their fingers through where the caterpillar has eaten. I also like the fact that during the first five days the caterpillar is eating one apple, two pears, three plums, etc. so we've also made this book into a counting story on occasion.The Very Hungry Caterpillar is one of my kids' favorite bedtime books and they love for me to read it to them! We love it so much we ordered it as a baby shower gift for a friend and she was pretty excited to receive it. I love the board book edition because it's very durable and we are still on our first copy after three years of twins looking at it quite a bit which is saying a lot! I can't say enough good things about this book and feel it would make a great gift for all babies and young children. I highly recommend it!",TRUE,children,Language.ENGLISH,

Well my dears, put away your knives and forks. There is no steak here. There is, however, plenty of sizzle, or whatever you might like to call the overabundance of hot air surrounding this sad little tome. Like many others who've reviewed this work, I too fell for the hype. The ""Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller!"" and ""Instant...Hollywood-bound...new thriller!""

And I have many years of experience in all aspects of the book trade, from submitted manuscripts through to finished -- marketed -- products.

Where to begin? Off the top of my head, (1) the writing is appalling - immature, stilted, flat, with far too much telling and not enough showing - and the author has an MA from Cambridge??? Wow. (2) the story doesn't make any sense (3) the attempted explanations for the pitiful plot are illogical in the extreme (the man she saw was Theo and he's the one who -- well, I won't give it away, even though in this case it hardly matters.) (4) the author's knowledge (I use the term loosely) of psychiatry and psychiatric illness is pitiful. The caveat that ""borderlines are seductive"" is repeated ad nauseam, yet I don't recall Alicia ever being diagnosed with such - never mind that most mental health professionals nowadays hesitate to affix the 'borderline' label because of its enormous stigma. (5) the 'celebrity' endorsements - how the frilly heck did that happen? I mean, please, tell me. Because for the life of me I can't figure it out. This is just a really, really, really bad book.

23542,63215381,1,"it's not a mystery novel, just an uninteresting story with forgettable characters",2,"my review of this book was censored by Amazon. Maybe because I used some strong words, I was really upset after reading it and having wasted my time and money. I will try to tune it down a little. The book is presented as a classic whoddunit, but it is not. We discover only at the end who is the victim (although at some point it becomes obvious) and when the murder is described, we learn immediately who is the killer, so no mystery to solve. The comparisons made to Agatha Christie are completely misleading. But it's not just this that makes it an horrible book. 99% of the book is the story of some young adults behaving like horny and superficial teenagers, obsessing about sex, and getting constantly drunk. The book is full of cliches, the characters are all bad stereotypes, and they are completely unrealistic: a mother who does not care about her childrens left at home, worries about her marriage, but nonetheless flirts with other guys, a groom who flirts with several women present at his wedding, and I could go on. Trivial events, such as a drinking game, or a toast at the wedding, are described with overly dramatic tones, becoming grotesque, maybe to justify that this is supposed to be a thriller? Speaking of which, episodes that should be scary are just utterly ridicoulous. The story in non-existent and the characters so annoying, unlikable and shallow, that at 1/3 into the book I just started skimming through, just to see how much worse it could get. I cannot believe that this is a best-seller. It is probably because nowadays it is only a matter of marketing, and the quality does not count much anymore.

15630,1984806734,1,Embarrassingly dated,2 people found this helpful,"""Lit Chick meets titan of literature."" He helps her deal with a daddy trauma, she heals his scarred soul. This story, riddled with hair-raising, vulgar clich√©s, was perhaps acceptable ten years ago, even if even then nothing could hide the poor craftsmanship.In the meantime, however, the time for this kind of half-baked nonsense has mercilessly come to an end.This story wouldn't be so bad in terms of its structure if the two protagonists weren't such clich√©d characters. January is the epitome of the WASP middle class millennials, unafraid to share her vulgar middle class views with the world, Gus is a stand in for ""lone wolf' writers like Raymond Carver, Don deLillo, Tom Wolfe.One of January's embarrassing cliches is: ‚ÄúSerious‚Äù writers purposely miss their readers' expectations, while honest genre artisans, like her, are always undervalued. To prove this platitude is the trigger for the narration of the book, and it is original in itself and one could have imagined turning it into an interesting battle between two writers who are secretly fond of each other, but are too proud to admit it openly and therefore dismantling each other's art, like Walter and Hildy in Howard Hawk's ""His Girl Friday"" or Mike and Tracy (Sinatra and Kelly) in ""High Society."" But this would have required a clear view of society, the gulf that is increasingly opening between the classes, and the prejudices that make living together so incredibly complicated.January as a brazen, unreflective middle-class daughter, who also suffers from acute panic because, being in in her late twenties she believes she has missed the train to marriage and family, would also be an excellent protagonist if the author had the necessary intellectual abilities to tackle the scrappy bourgeoisCanon of Faith she endorses and teach January a lesson. But unfortunately the author sticks with January, trying to generate empathy in the reader for her young girl's dreams of how Gus finally conquers her and she willingly surrenders to the conquest.All in all, this book is as unsavory as this sounds, and to top it off, to somehow compensate for the missing physical rapprochement, the protagonist indulges in overconsumption of second rate foods, and the author delights us with detailed descriptions of the resulting digestive problems and their glaring consequences.But certainly the most disgusting and intolerable part of this story is January's unreflected, blind teenager love for her late father. For the entire length of the book, she never gets over the betrayal that her father had a lover and thus destroyed her ideal of him and her parents' marriage.",FALSE,romance,Language.ENGLISH,

Not a die-hard fan like some people are, but I've always loved to read, talk about and analyze the Harry Potter books. Seeing that I would never likely make it to London to watch this much-anticipated play, I decided to spend the 15 dollars and at least read the script. My impression was that this play would be really fun to watch, with dimensions brought alive by the acting, stage tech, props, etc. However, the script itself seemed very amateur. There were parts that almost made it, but overall, it felt as though I was reading a fan-fiction. The character and plot development were weak. I understand that this is a script for a play so it could lack the complexities we found in the novels. However, the characters seemed two-dimensional or out of character. The things they did or said were either too predictable or too outlandish. Basically, I found this world of magic unbelievable and shallow. The plot was not entirely predictable, but it was definitely not original. It felt like a (spoiler here?) mash-up between Harry Potter and Back to the Future 2. The theme was obvious, but could've been delivered in a more masterful, creative way than was presented in this script. All to say, this script will fall short for Harry Potter fans who love the books for the intricate plots, attention to detail, and complex character developments. Because this script lacks all of that. As I said in the title, it may be great to watch the play unfold on stage, but it certainly wasn't as exciting to read on paper.",TRUE,children,Language.ENGLISH,

In my view, it has completely reversed my attitude toward ‚Äúscience fiction‚Äù which I had always mentally dismissed as a fantasy genre about, mainly, Martians. This book opened wide my eyes to experience what Bradbury himself referred to as ‚Äúspeculative fiction.‚Äù I found it wildly imaginative, prophetic, and poetic.Reading this was like dreaming a nightmare in which things are upside-down and/or inside-out. Books, for example, are designated ‚Äúenemies of the state‚Äù because they cause people to think, and thinking leads to unhappiness -- and in the crazy ‚Äúfun house‚Äù of this wildly imaginated world, happiness is their utmost goal.But life inside this ‚Äúfun house‚Äù is no fun at all. Citizens here live literally surrounded by televised soap operas displayed life-size: on walls (whole walls!) ‚Äì the three walls of a room. They live their lives vicariously watching and hoping for a fourth wall to complete the room. When not watching the walls, they use ear buds and tune into whatever is being piped into them from the powers-that-be. Their attentions thus focused and diverted, the people become numbed down and dumbed down. Eventually, many seem catatonic; others are suicidal, and dozens attempt suicide daily with dozens more succeeding.Another ‚Äúnightmare inversion‚Äù is the Fire Department that is never sent to extinguish a conflagration, but instead, to set a specific home ON fire. Their mission is to extinguish all the books before literature leads people to question the status quo. Ergo the fire-fighters in reverse, along with their faithful hound who is not a Dalmatian but a programmed computer in the shape of a dog who hunts down all dissenters and kills each one by injection.There are, of course, dissenters who manage to escape the unexamined lifestyle and share the task of memorizing the best of books even as they burn into ashes. They are like old-fashioned hobos, a remnant, dedicated to keeping wisdom alive as they evade the horrible hound hunting with its syringe until the end of its world.This book is ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äù at its best. Ray Bradbury found a way to say what he believed without preaching: SHOWING that a person truly exists only when exercising all senses and exerting all faculties. One reviewer called this book a ‚ÄúMene, mene, tekel¬†of things to come.‚Äù Years later, Marshall McLuhan began warning that the media is the message that can shape people and produce a placid, non-questioning, passive populace. But Bradbury beat him to it. He even had the syringe.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,

This book has so much information, and being new to 5E, I cannot see if it is all correct but so far it looks intact.

If this book was at a store I would ask for a refund or exchange. It is not worth the extra costs to return via the internet. I think the book might be repairable with a low heat gun, weights, and time, to fix the wobbly pages.

With cameras everywhere now and the NSA, it is not preposterous to think it could happen not in our lifetimes, but in a future far from now. It explains how the past is rewritten (as history is constantly being done now)to the point where there was no past. Children born think this is the way the world (Oceana) always was. To think that George Orwell wrote this in 1948 shows the forethought he had to write such a book. I wish this book was still on the high school reading lists! There is a big message that there should be no one ""rich"" and everyone should be the same,(socialism which is being pushed now) BUT the proles are poor and have very little.

Here‚Äôs the real kicker, the affair had not just occurred at any time. It was when her mother had cancer. So, one year later, January arrives in the small town of North Bear Shores with more baggage, anger, and confusion than she knows how to manage. Her father left her the house he and his mistress had bought during the affair. It was finally time for her to clean it out, spend the remainder of the summer writing, and then, once finished with her novel, sell the home. As a published, romance novelist, January struggles to find the rose-colored glasses she used to wear, making writing all the more tedious. Fortuitously, January discovers that her new neighbor is Augustus Everett: her formal college, and literary, rival and love obsession. After a series of awkward meetings and angsty banter, she learns that Gus is also struggling with his next book. They make a deal: Gus will write a romance novel and January will write her attempt at ‚Äòbleak literary fiction‚Äô. The first one to get a book deal wins. They spend the summer showing each other the ins and outs of the research they do; Gus showing August the burn down remains of a nearby cult and January taking Gus dancing. As they both process their own grief and come to terms with, they find themselves leaning on each for support.The Beach Read is a witty, sexy, slow-burn romance that brings light and possibility to second chances.

Her relationship is easy but lacks any real depth. Seeing Elliot shakes her very foundation and has her questioning her choices.

These were two special people who found one another early in life... until circumstances bisected them. Teenage Macy and Elliot had this delicious push and pull, where they both knew they had feelings that exceeded the bounds of friendship, but were hesitant to jeopardize the special bond they shared.

1822,786965606,4,Inspired Re-imagining of the System With Great Scaling and Options - But Lacking Balance in Some Manners,,"Summary:  A very good, inspired re-imagining rife with options for both veterans and newbies, but with a few holes and some completely unbalanced classes and abilities that require some thinking.My credentials:  Playing D&D since the mid-80's, grinding my teeth on Keep Beyond the Borderlands, and White Plume Mountain playing 1st edition religiously.  Have tried every edition, voraciously using save for horrendous 4th edition.  Played Pathfinder religiously for past few years, despite its shortcomings.  Unlike other reviewers, I have waited over five months of playing to post the review here.Let's look at the Good:* Back to roots - The classes are in their original spirit (largely).  We have cast aside picking powers and True-Resurrected many sacred cows that in the prior edition had been slain.  Vancian Magic is back!  It feels like D&D again.* Options galore - most of classes have 3 or more ""versions"" to choose from that do make for a legitimately variable experience. The new Feats are more potent, and interesting in principal.  Not every person has a mithril breastplate* The Scaling - Oh my, we really have tackled the problem of 3.x and Pathfinder pretty successfully here in an innovative manner.  It was hard to imagine Armor Class mattering like it does again and spells brought in check just enough with the new concentration rules.  3.x had a tyranny of ""commoditized"" bonuses of all sorts that pushed higher level characters to places where only the most epic of foes mattered.  Now theoretically, even minor foes en masse or working with powerful ones can have a role.  Characters don't end up with ability scores in the 30's.  Brilliant.* The streamlining:  Advantage / Disadvantage rules are wonderfully easy mechanics, and other resolution rules were made simple like saving throws.* The Flavor:  It really is a tasty book and system - it is hard not like all the ideas, and even the spirit of the rules. Like what they did with the races and options there.The Negatives:Despite the many good reviews it is hard to overlook that it feels like a system not adequately play-tested for fairness.* Loop-holes:  Some class abilities are so overpowered it is beyond understanding.  For example, a barbarian can easily gain resistance to all damage types save for psychic (which is rare) which effectively doubles already high hit points versus any other character... a Ranger can cast hunter's mark, use Colossus Slayer, and fire and ignore cover with Sharpshooter feat (if allowed), and also has access to the Archery combat style which inexplicably gives.* Balance:  Even without loopholes, unfortunately, the players are more powerful than monsters of an equivalent CR (by a fair margin) now that we have the DMG - so that is just plain broken.  You have to throw much more potent creatures to make a challenge and it renders the XP system useless.  Ranged and Spell Cantrips remain very powerful now versus melee attacks for a variety of reasons, including that damage and bonus to hit are both based on score and damage differentials are off.* The Patterns: There seems to have been every effort to give a martial class a way to inflict similar damage in slightly different contexts - e.g., Rogue sneak attack, Paladin smite, Ranger Picks, Barbarian Rage damage, etc.* Over-Simplifications:  Critical system was gutted, differences between weapons gutted, some of the old combat maneuvers reserved for fighters only now.  And the Attack of opportunity rules are mindless - why change them from 3.x?  And this is for my DMG review (a mostly lacking book) but the magic item system and prices make little sense for sake of simplicity.* Some Outlier Rules:  Superiority Dice, Bardic Music Bonuses, Bless, and other things don't seem to fit the system as much.* Some Big ""Brokens"": Why even mention multi-classing as an optional rule if it clearly doesn't work the way they do it?  A player can tap into wonderful abilities with ease just getting to 1st level.  It is pretty asinine.Conclusion:  Despite the list of negatives, the advantages of this system so far renders it superior to Pathfinder and also a source of fresh ways to play that can be grittier and scaled much better across character levels.  It is fun to actually feel like we are playing D&D again!  Unfortunately, you are going to find as people get into the 2nd, 3rd generation of campaigns lots of house rules are applied and balancing adjustments made.  It could have been made better.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,

21546,125030170X,2,Not Well Written,17,"This is a read that I was thrilled about. It‚Äôs everywhere- on Tiktok, on Instagram, on Facebook- everyone talks about their recent reads and this book always seems to be in that list. I‚Äôve heard glowing reviews, excitement to read it, and hype up to the max degree. Which is why my review is a dismal 2/5 stars, as it didn‚Äôt live up to the hype, and in fact, it horrifies me that so many people enjoyed this novel. At first, I found myself perplexed by the tone of the novel. It felt less like I was reading a mental health professional, and more like I was reading an old detective novel. What should have been a read that sucked me in and went quickly, was instead painfully slow. I felt the book crawling, and found the writing to be dry, rife with short statement sentences that made the music of the book tonally flat. I haven‚Äôt read anything else by Alex Michaelides- though The Maidens is in my TBR list- and I don‚Äôt know if this is the author‚Äôs voice, or if it‚Äôs just this particular novel‚Äôs tone, but it was thoroughly unenjoyable and I found myself waiting for it to pick up. Finally, it did- at least I thought so. We got into more character development, more from Alicia‚Äôs perspective, but‚Ä¶ this is where I found the most fault. The formatting of this novel is downright bizarre: Each part resets the count of the chapters, which was aggravating to say the least. That is a method I‚Äôve seen used in non-fiction but never in fiction, and I found myself irritated. Not only that, but throughout the novel are Alicia‚Äôs ‚Äúdiary entries‚Äù, bits of story told from her perspective. But this pissed me off! They are titled diary entries, and she even explains she‚Äôs writing down her thoughts: But they‚Äôre written like scenes. Many of them contain full back and forth dialogue, with perfect recollection. I would have rather seen them just as they were: Alicia‚Äôs point of view scenes. Having them be ‚Äúdiary entries‚Äù was angering, because they weren‚Äôt. Diary entries, when written by a character, are not written in this way. I found it distracting, taking me out of the book and unable to connect with Alicia. The wonky formatting did nothing but lower my opinion of this book, and make it impossible to relax into the novel. As the book went on, I became increasingly aware of two more things I despised: The way mental health is handled, for one, and sexual commentary through Alicia‚Äôs point of view, for another. On the first point, this is a book steeped in mental health, with most of the cast of characters being therapists or doctors- or having mental health issues. Some areas are done well, but some are done so horribly that it makes me shudder to think of people reading this book and taking this portrayal as fact. The opinion of main character Theo regarding the patients at The Grove can sometimes be not only ignorant, but offensive. I think a lot of the mental health related moments in this book are poorly researched, or just poorly presented. As for my second point: Moments where Alicia described her husband, and her feelings for him, were often cringeworthy to read. She was written with this idolization of him, this passionate desire for him in perfectly normal, everyday situations. It was as if reading one of those internet memes about ‚Äúmen writing women‚Äù. I think it was unappealing, poorly done, and bordering on unrealistic. I found myself wondering why the abrupt sexual commentary was in this book at all- because it popped up more than once. The one decent thing I can say about this story is that it has all the beats of a good story- even if they‚Äôre poorly done. There are decent bits of character descriptions when they get introduced, the story idea is solid, and there were some parts that weren‚Äôt so bad. But the way this story is told was horrendous. Shifting timelines lead to a really big payoff to the mystery- but only if you don‚Äôt figure it out before you get there, and unfortunately, there were some fairly big tells for the end if you are an experienced reader of thrillers, or if you were paying enough attention. Not only that, but there are some storylines that go unanswered, and they feel like they were just there to distract and trick. I felt like the end reveal was the focus and everything that led up to it was just meant to be a distraction, instead of a real part of the story. It was annoying to see all these ideas go nowhere. Most of all, the thing that infuriated me the most was that the entire book is about one simple question. Why is Alicia silent- why doesn‚Äôt she talk? Only, the answer to this is not a good one. It‚Äôs deeply metaphoric, surrounded by a Greek myth, full of intrigue- but the payoff is so poor, and it leaves a lot to be desired. The most important aspect of this book, and it‚Äôs utterly disappointing. Overall, this book is probably a 3/5. But I chose to give it a 2/5 because of my struggle to get through it, and my disappointment in comparison to the hype. I regret wasting my time reading it. I write about mental health all the time- so to see this book, a poor excuse for representation, get so much undeserved hype makes me all the more upset. This is a slow, agonizing read that made me grit my teeth, and I hope those who read it are not easily fooled by the tricks that cover up what is an amazing plot turned into mush by poor writing.",TRUE,children,Language.ENGLISH,

She‚Äôs moved into a beach house that she didn‚Äôt know her father owned so she can pack it up and sell it. This is a hugely emotional thing for her, but at the same time, she‚Äôs supposed to be writing her next book by the end of the summer. The only problem with this is that she hasn‚Äôt even started and when she tries, she has no ideas. Things get interesting when she realizes who her neighbor is.Augustus Everett is a fellow writer, one that January actually went to college with. I really liked him from the start. It was immediately clear that these two had certain assumptions about one another that weren‚Äôt really true. So, Gus and January make a deal where Gus will spend the summer writing a romance novel and January will write literary fiction. I loved that this became sort of cathartic for January. She used this new challenge to try to work through all of the things she has going on in her life. I just really enjoyed the writing aspects of the story. I also totally loved the flirtation that was included for some of the writing parts. Also, as a part of their deal, the two adventured together. Friday nights they would go somewhere that Gus had previously planned for book research and January would take Gus on field trips that one might find in a romance novel. I loved these because they were both so different. So, Fridays they‚Äôd deal with some really heavy stuff and Saturdays they would go to the carnival or something.

We are in 1984. Mr W. Smith works at the Ministry of Truth. Mr Smith is very lucid about his job and what is going on, so he shuts his mouth up. To make a living, he writes the Parti's history/truth so it is totalitary (lol) in ad√©quation with the idealogy in place and consequently, it is more suitable for the mass. 1984 was written by G.Orwell a few years after WWII. It is an anticipation book, but also a philosophical book about totalitarianism. In 1984 the world at war consists of Eurasia, Estasia and Oceania, 3 dictatorships which have all given the  importance to Ideology and all forgot about individuals and liberty. Technology is at the service of the power in place to manipulate you psychologically: of course, Big Brother dominates you, but no worries, he is just here to look after you!

When I started reading, I thought maybe I didn‚Äôt wait long enough. (Usually it‚Äôs more than a year.) Not because I wasn‚Äôt liking the story, but I wasn‚Äôt sure about the pacing. But I was wrong, this story is wonderful.There are so many beautiful moments between January and Augustus (and don‚Äôt you just love their names?). Yet it wasn‚Äôt all roses and songbirds. Both parties went into this friendship with caution‚Ä¶lots and lots of caution. This is actually a reconnection, these two have a past. And I love how that part is written. That awkward realization that you know someone, but not being sure if they remember you. Acting like you don‚Äôt know them because you don‚Äôt want to look like a fool if they dismiss you. Really, the author got that all so spot on.Once these two open up about their past and start a tentative friendship, things take off. Their notes and encouragement to one another, the inside jokes and support, all of it is beautiful. Even while their feelings are growing and deepening, you know there is still so much damage deep in their souls and wonder if they can truly find peace within themselves in order to make any sort of long term relationship work.I love that both characters are authors. They both have different processes and drastically different genres, but they‚Äôre willing to learn from each other. Being a romance writer, January certainly knows the traps and downfalls of new relationships. Doesn‚Äôt stop her from falling into those traps. This story truly shows that people love in different ways. It doesn‚Äôt mean one way is better than another, but maybe you‚Äôre reading cue incorrectly if you don‚Äôt fully understand a person yet.I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt put off reading this book any longer than I did.

I will add the ending of the book tries to be edgy and this huge deep thing and that really irritated me and killed the entire purpose of it for me.",TRUE,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,

7199,B01M0JHBEG,5,we love lift the flaps!,,"This book is a lot of fun for Halloween, with innocent costumes on animals. You lift the flaps to see ""under the masks"" to discover which animals are wearing which costumes. The usual Little Blue Truck rhymes accompany each discovery, with a final full-page flap at the end revealing the final surprise. My 6 month old likes hearing the rhymes, but can't quite last through the whole book yet. She is very interested in lifting the flaps though, so that keeps her engaged. It is nice to have a Halloween book that is more fun than spooky for baby.",TRUE,children,Language.ENGLISH,
