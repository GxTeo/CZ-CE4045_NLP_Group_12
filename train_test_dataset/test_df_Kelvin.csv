Scorpius and Albus constantly whinging about whether it's OK to hug, Hermione and Ron pulling apart so no one sees them kissing (they're MARRIED!), Harry vacillating between asking advice and ignoring it ... oh, the drama, the anxiety, the hand-wringing! It's as if they not only haven't grown or developed since we last saw them, but have regressed. It isn't due to being presented in ""play"" form; I can read a play and envision the emotions and descriptions that are left out. It's due to the terrible character ""development"" (of which there is very little) and the way in which beloved characters (Ron, Hermione, Harry, Draco, Snape, Dumbledore, etc.), who were developed lovingly and extensively over 7 previous books, suddenly act like whiny babies, or broadly comedic fools, or over-sensitive children instead of adults. Professor McGonagall, one of my favorite characters in the ""real"" books, loses her sternness, her sense of fairness, her common sense, and comes off as vacillating and foolish. Dumbledore seems to be suffering from old age dementia, with his bumbling ""advice"" and teariness. I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and fully expected to love and cherish this book. Instead I HATED it.

19,17894,399587683,4,The Proposal by Jasmine Guillory,,"I remember back in the day when I was just finishing The Wedding Date and the only thing I could think about was ""I need a Carlos book. How do I convince Guillory to write one?"" As it turns out, I did NOT have to convince her at all. This one was already in the works!  Nik's day started out as going well. But then out of nowhere in the middle of a baseball game her boyfriend decides to PURPOSE. On a JUMBOTRON. Nik does everything short of dying from embarrassment, but out of nowhere, two people are there to save the day: Carlos and his little sister, Angie. They help Nik battle the news cameras and get her out of there before she can even blink. You would think it's over now, but for the two of them, it's only the beginning.....  From the very beginning Carlos has been my favorite character in this series. But in this one he seemed a bit different than he was in The Wedding Date. He seemed a bit more arrogant and a little more of a jerk. I didn't care for the change. I wanted the same Carlos that got Drew to realize he fell in love with Alexa. As for Nik, I really liked her. She reminded me of me. Which I find hilarious because I would have tried to date Carlos too lol She was just like me in so many ways that I wasn't expecting, which made her so much more realistic.  With their romance, I loved seeing them together. It was definitely an instance where everyone else knows EXCEPT those people. But their journey to get there was so much better that way. I loved the way they interacted with each other and the way they tried to make themselves think they didn't matter to the other. All the signs of real love.  The only thing I didn't care for about this one was the ending. I HATED the way he decided to let her know what he wanted to tell her. It just seemed like too much and the way he said it felt even to me that he was just saying something and he wasn't sure if he meant it. And then at the very end, I felt like Guillory stopped it in the middle of a scene. She could have stopped it before ending it like that.  The Wedding Date is still my favorite, but this one is a close second. Jasmine Guillory is for sure one romance author to watch. I can't wait to see what else she has in store!",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

These books are a part of me, I've named my children after characters in these books. I have 3 tattoos, all of which are harry potter. I'm a dedicated fan, entirely obsessed to be candid. I have waited for this book like the rest of you. I can handle the fact that it's written as a play, I was expecting this. I was fully prepared to accept this. I waited all night for this to be released to my kindle (it's 3 a.m and I've just finished). I sped through the cursed child and my final thought was, this was disappointing . I'm skeptical of how much jk rowling actually contributed to this. I get more of a harry potter vibe from the fantastic beasts trailer than this entire book. The plot was bad, almost everything was bad. It was like a poorly written fanfic. It sucks that I'm saying this because harry potter is a part of soul. I went into this thinking it was everything I'd ever hoped for. I'm not saying don't buy the book, by all means buy it. Read it. See for yourself. I'm not being cynical, rowling is the queen of my world. This is the first and likely only bad review I will give regarding her. Just be warned, this does not feel like harry potter. This was not intricate, well excuted, thought out, or clever. The characters were not true to themselves. I think the best way to go into reading this and saving yourself from despair is to read it as a fanfic and not the true works of rowling. It would be tolerable had her name not been involved, I expected so much more. And now I will try to purge this book from my memory and continue to live in her past works of art. I still have big hopes for fantastic beasts and that's enough for now.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH,-1,-1

I think a lot of my issues come with the writing. I felt the characters that we potter-heads knew and loved were somehow changed into characters we'd never met before.

It really simplifies gameplay and puts more emphasis on developing a character over having the best stats. It really simplifies skills and combat with the proficiency bonuses being equally applied to the things your class is good at. Some folks might not like that you can't be super specialized in one particular skill, but I think it is a good idea. Character creation involves coming up with personality traits, unbending ideals, ties to the setting, and flaws, making for a fleshed out character and preventing someone from having a backstory of ""Is an elf"". The system even has a mechanic to reward players for playing to their character with inspiration points.I think my favorite new mechanic is the advantage/disadvantage system, which has you roll two D20s, and take the higher or lower depending on which you have. It helps mitigate those problems when you have built a character to be awesome at something in particular, but you just keep getting crappy rolls and your badass ranger can't hit the broad side of a giant with a single arrow.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

This edition re-captures what makes D&D great, and has breathed new life into the game. Combat is deadly and exciting. I have run this with 3-7 players and in all capacities has worked without glitch. The advantage/disadvantage mechanic simple and effective. When I'm unsure of the exact modifiers etc, I'll just offer advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation.The classes are interesting - containing all the oldies and goodies, but with new options like warlock.

This was an adorable, light read that touched on heavy topics but was also an adorable romcom. I read this book after Book Lovers and I will say that I enjoyed this one more than Book Lovers, although both were good.Quick Synopsis: January is a romance author who squirrels away for the summer to the beach house her late father bought for his mistress. All resentment aside, January is working through her father‚Äôs betrayal after his passing, especially when she thought her parents were deeply in love and lived a seemingly perfect life. When she runs into her collegiate writing rival, Gus, in town, and finds that he lives next door, the two make a bet: she‚Äôs going to write the classic American novel with a sad ending and he‚Äôs going to write a romance novel, and whoever sells their novel first, wins.Trigger warnings include but are not limited to: death of a parent, cheating (not the Main characters), abusive parents, trauma from abuseHere‚Äôs what I liked:-January and Gus have the greatest banter between the two of them. I found myself laughing just because of their witty repartee.-The way January and Gus develop as people as well as together was beautifully developed; slow, but steady and vibrant.-I loved the ending and how it was equal parts dramatic, funny, and beautiful.-The development we get between January and her father who passed away and how she learns about his history and also why he made the choices he made, was so realistic. It‚Äôs a cycle of learning, understanding, resentment, and then eventual forgiveness, that was incredibly realistic and also engaging to read about if you‚Äôve gone through anything similar.-January is a wonderful protagonist and someone you can relate to but also really root for.-I loved that Gus wasn‚Äôt some super machismo main character but was described as average height and lean and lanky.-The novels they both end up writing, with the hyperbolistic endings, were so funny, but also beautifully ironic. It‚Äôs honestly such a brilliant take on American  and novel endings in a very meta way.Here‚Äôs what I struggled with:-While this was an engaging read, but for some reason (and this could be just my mindset right now) I wasn‚Äôt fully absorbed into the novel. Although I did enjoy it.-All my tabs are gone because I kept tabbing every conversation January and Gus have and now I have to go buy more. Annoying.

Folks think that they understand the hardships of growing up different from others, but most are truly clueless.  Well written, humorous and often sad at the same time, a true eye opener that explains just how messed up governments can treat people.  One would think that in the 21st Century nothing like this would happen in the USA, but there are areas of our country and far too many folks within those areas that have the same attitudes today as those of the South African government.I'm not saying my difficulties growing up were anywhere near what Mr. Noah's were, but they were scarily similar.  I learned as a military brat that even having the correct skin color doesn't guarantee equal treatment in the USA, and I feel I have more in common with him than with my own brothers.  When your family moves every 18 months you're always the ""new kid"" and the ""outsider"".  Moving from a Southern state to a Northern state or the other way around can be the worst.  The ""War Between The States"" comes into the mix because the attitudes of that time are still very much alive in the minds of many children in both of those areas of our country, and their treatment of an ""outsider"" can be brutal.

202,17120,1501128019,4,Sweet and messy,,"Proceed With Caution:This book deals with death and grief.The Basics:Love and Other Words is a romance-centric Women's Fiction novel about Macy. It alternates between present day when she's unexpectedly reunited with her first (and only) love and the past when they first met up until they had a falling out. Neither has gotten over the other, but they've also never talked about what happened eleven years ago that forced them apart.My Thoughts:I don't normally read Women's Fiction, but Love and Other Words sounded interested, so I decided to give it a try. And I'm so glad that I did! I was immediately hooked into Macy's story even though there was nothing specific that I can pinpoint. I just wanted to know what happened to her and see her get her happy ending. I also just loved the past chapters, because she and Elliot are just too freaking adorable for words. They're both avid readers and spend a ton of time together just reading. Four years of being alone together and just reading. Seriously.The focus of Love and Other Words is on the relationship between Macy and Elliot, so it does read like a Contemporary Romance, which was good for me. It's just a change of pace, since it doesn't follow the general romantic progression, as we also need to work through Macy's emotional trauma, which is done through her relationship with Elliot. We don't know what happened to separate them for over a decade; it's slowly revealed. I did guess, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment, because there was still a lot of baggage to unpack surrounding it.Love and Other Words also deals heavily with grief. Macy's mother dies when she's ten and leaves her father a list of ""rules"" to help him raise a teenage daughter. One of those things was to find her a weekend getaway when she's feeling stressed, which he takes very literally and buys a second home. Next door to Elliot. Macy doesn't talk much about her mother, but over time does open up Elliot about it, since he does ask her and lets her know that he's there if she does want to talk. Then we learn that Macy's father also passed sometime within those eleven years, and she still hasn't dealt with it at all. Her feelings there are completely mingled up with her feelings for Elliot.I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that I really enjoyed Love and Other Words. The teen romance was really sweet and kind of messy. The present day is even more messy because Macy is extremely avoidant of her emotions, which is quite understandable given her history of letting people get close.",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH,0,1

Noah‚Äôs ability to reflect on how his life fit into the greater fabric of apartheid and the aftermath was exceptional.

I understand that this came from essays, which helps explain it a bit, but it didn‚Äôt seem like separate essays.  It seemed like a generally cohesive story that occasionally jumped around. This was particularly problematic toward the end, when he had finished high school, had a job, lost the job, then <bam> let‚Äôs talk about how my mother and stepfather met when I was 9. I get that he likely wanted to present that whole story about their relationship at once, for dramatic effect...? But I felt a little confused sometimes about WHEN certain events were occurring, which kind of took me ‚Äúout‚Äù of the story.Just as an aside, I also wished that there was more about how he made it OUT of poverty. It felt like one minute he‚Äôs selling bootlegged CDs on a street corner, and the next he‚Äôs a comedian. I think part of what is remarkable about his story is that he came from such meager circumstances and managed to climb out and achieve great success. It‚Äôs inspiring, to be sure.

It‚Äôs about two writers working through soul-crushing writer‚Äôs block, grief, betrayal and deciding to manage it all by switching things up and trying one another‚Äôs genres all while investigating a horrible suicide cult. Yes, suicide cult. There is a substantial depth to this book, as if you‚Äôre eating a really wonderful, sinfully delicious meal that is also somehow good for you. You get the cake and the veggies all in one.There are some excellent quips and monologues by the lead female author / character, January Andrews, who writes women‚Äôs fiction with happily ever afters (which is very meta and which I cannot quote as I read an advance copy) about women‚Äôs fiction and how it‚Äôs ridiculous that it‚Äôs a separate category from just plain FICTION because the person writing it happens to have different ""equipment"". I‚Äôm really, really paraphrasing. Emily Henry says it much more brilliantly.The lead male author/character, Augustus Everett is the same ‚ÄúSexy Evil Gus‚Äù whom January went to college with and had a rather one-sided rivalry with. Gus writes dark, nihilistic novels with no happy ending in sight. At first they butt heads, they make assumptions about one another but gradually bond over their writing and writer‚Äôs block and the bet they make to trade genres: which of course means that Gus will have to write a romance with a happy ever after and January will have to write a ‚Äúdark and brooding book‚Äù. January might not have a problem with that as she‚Äôs just had the worst year of her life.Eventually Gus and January get closer and Emily Henry becomes slightly obsessed with describing Gus‚Äô dark eyes. I didn‚Äôt know there were that many ways to describe dark eyes. Now I do! Romance ensues! Swoon!It took me a while to write this review because I really wanted to marinate in the book a bit. I had a book hangover. Yes. It doesn‚Äôt get a solid five from me because the suicide cult was a little confusing and I‚Äôm not sure I truly understood why it was in the book at all.

I've seen Trevor Noah in concert, watched his special and have watched The Daily Show. His is a brilliance not often seen, balanced with a sincerity and desire to connect which keeps him from remotely being arrogant.Many people would call him lucky, but you do not get to where he is without paying many dues or nepotism. Since nepotism doesn't exist for him in Hollywood or in the larger world of comedy, he's paid his dues. Many of them are written about in this amazing book. He manages to truly impart a message, while making you laugh or cry with his story of the moment. His mother is a woman I have never met, but I respect wholeheartedly. When you read the book, I suspect that you too will feel the same way.His story overall is written with a calm measured voice and is told with equanimity. Some of the things are outrageous and unthinkable, some are heartbreaking, some contain a measure of hilarity that will literally have you laughing out loud. As unusual and as difficult a life Trevor Noah started out with, he never feels sorry for himself.He does allow himself to acknowledge that certain things were very difficult or unfair to a high degree, yet he handles everything with grace. His mother believes in the power of Jesus, and Trevor Noah believes in the power of his mother. She is a person That has true grit, a strength and a power and a purpose. I would imagine she's not even remotely surprised at her son's success. She showed him many paths, she showed him the way to so many things and never let anything stop her. Her son, Trevor Noah, is clearly his mother's child.This book educated me so much on the horrors of apartheid, the outlandish and horrific things that were done by people to people simply because of melanin. He doesn't excellent job of also showing the difficulties of post-apartheid South Africa. He is brilliant, he is exceptionally talented, and this book is one that I will read more than once, just so that I can gain every drop of knowledge, humor, laugh at All the funny parts again, and feel all of the sorrows- because in its entirety this book, this tale of the start of a life is an experience one rarely gets.

265,21201,399255370,1,"""Crayons have feelings too."" Really?? This should be titled ""Duncan Gets Guilted into Using All of His Crayons Equally.""",68,"Thankfully I did not spend money on this book. I happened to see it on a teacher's table and picked it up to see what kind of message was inside for the kindergartners in the classroom. What I found was not only annoying, but also riddled with complaint after complaint intended to instill guilt over offending inanimate objects. Each crayon was so so upset, or had it's feelings hurt, or felt used, or not used enough, or used only for certain things all the time.... So after many pages of each color having their sob story rant fest, (at this point little Duncan should've noticed how much more worn down the crayons made themselves by writing long whiney letters, and just thrown them all away, and gotten new quiet ones with nice pointy tips to use), but, instead, he caved and appeased them by coloring a large picture using all the colors in equal measure (Insert Angels singing here.) I almost gagged. (Although the picture was really cute it wasn't the point). This book is telling small kids that they should always be worried about offending someone to the point of paranoia. Books should teach kids to be themselves, to do their best, to THINK, to use reason, and to not let others manipulate them. Too many people use the ""I'm offended"" thing to manipulate and gain appeasement from others and this is the LAST thing we should be teaching kids to accept as normal.

268,17848,399587683,3,‚≠ê‚≠êüí´(2.5)/5,,"<u>The Proposal</u> by Jasmine Guillory was one of my November Book of the Month picks. It sounded like a light and refreshing rom-com book, which sounded like a good palate cleanser after my nonfiction November picks and the mysteries and thrillers that I'm usually drawn to. This story is straight-up made for the big screen. The big ballgame proposal, the various restaurants that are thoroughly described, and the quirky best friends all made me think of the best recipe for a chick flick. One which I'd gladly go to. However, spending more than two hours immersed in this story left me a bit disappointed with my time investment.What I LikedThe diversity of characters in this story was refreshing. There are black, Latino, Latina, and white characters. There are straight, bisexual, and gay characters. There are thin and round characters. I loved it!What Wasn‚Äôt My FavoriteThis story is cheesy. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to cheesy. But, this story was predictable and left me wondering why I bothered to read the end when I knew exactly what was going to happen.The conversation, particularly the dialogue of the male characters, was so stereotypical and pretty obviously written by a woman. The men pretty much always said exactly what a woman would want him to say!Some of the attention to detail was lacking in this story. For example, the first time Nik goes to Carlos's house, he says that he doesn't have a dining table yet because he hasn't quite gotten around to making his house the way he wants yet. But then the next time Nik goes over, they lay out their massive haul of freezer meals on the dining table. Not sure when he got one, but it felt like an oversight and made me annoyed.Rating ‚≠ê‚≠êüí´(2.5)/5 - Rounded up for Amazon",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH,0,0

Unless, of course, you are a masochist, in which case, crack on. From the contrived meet cute until the it-can't-come-soon-enough-for-me end, this 'will they/won't they' debacle is a disaster. The repetitive reference to 'what happened in Croatia', the dime-store romance 'almost' hookups, Poppy's self-indulgence, Alex's 'sad puppy face' all add up to a cloying, pointless, excruciating read. I just cannot understand all the hype. We read this for a book group--the only reason I finished it and didn't use it for kindling. (Well, not yet, anyway.) There is no plot, just a lot of disjointed flashbacks. The writing is clumsy. Every single character is clich√©d, from Poppy's ditzy parents to the awful Airbnb host and honeymooners they meet on their current vacation. And Alex and Poppy are two of the most unlikable characters you will ever have the misfortune to come across. Poppy is meant to be a hippy-dippy, happy-go-lucky cutie. Alex is meant to be a serious, stable, but smoldering-hot brooding type.Epic fail: instead, Poppy comes across more like the attention-grabbing toddler your third cousin brought to the wedding even though she was told kids weren't allowed and who spilled her juice box on the bride's dress. Before the ceremony. And Alex is a mind-numbingly boring, condescending prat. You will find yourself rooting for them to get together, but only so they take each other out of the dating pool with the least amount of collateral damage. However, there was a silver lining: For the first time in the existence of our book group, we were all in agreement on how we felt about a book. And because this was the absolute worst bit of tat we had ever slogged through, it did create that special bond usually found amongst trauma survivors.

When I first got this book, I don't expect to be and have exactly everything the same as the other Books and/or movie, but this was just disappointing! SPOILERS --------> 1: Characters. So Ron. He isn't the witty, kindhearted man/boy we saw in the series. This book just had him as comic relief, and honestly, I didn't like that. Hermione, she was foolish enough to hide the Time Turner in a BOOK of all places! Hermione isn't that foolish. Even then, when Albus and Scorpius went back in time, she wasn't patient, she pressured her students. Now Albus and Scorpius. Scorpius is a nice boy, but he was also foolish. He let Albus lead him back in time, resulting in losing Rose, and Albus being no longer alive. I honestly wonder why Scorpius is even in Slytherin. Albus as well. Albus is very Very VERY stupid. He broke into the Ministry, stole the Time Turner, resulting in going back in time and losing Rose, Voldemort being alive and such. He even made Cedric be an Death eater. Speaking of that. Why would embarrassing Cedric in the Triwizard tournament turn him into a Death Eater? Honestly, that doesn't make sense. Now for Delphi , Voldemort, and Bellatrix. It says that they have a child but isn't Voldemort incapable of loving? Even so, it says that this happened when Hermione Pollyjuiced into Malfoy Manor. How did they not notice Bellatrix being pregnant when sneaking in? This is mad. Now Dumbledore. He barely was in here, but he wasn't any help emotionally. I wonder why he left when Draco walked into the room Well. Harry, he isn't what he used to be. Before he learned to control his feelings, what he says, and etc. But they changed that all. Honestly, if Ms. Rowling read this, she would be disappointed GREATLY. 2. Plot. Now, I don't understand why they even added the flashbacks. They were unneeded, and a waste of time.

The story of an overprivileged young woman who insists on sleeping 24 hours a day and all the misadventures she has while she is semicomatose and sleep-walking through her upscale neighborhood. She has an on and off affair with a psychologically sadistic boyfriend and sleeps with anyone who has a penis while she isn't with him. And the author goes into great detail about just how this boyfriend abuses her. This book ever makes pornography look like great works of art.

Yes, an amateur's writing from when they were 15 years old is more palpable than this cursed child of a story. Time travel. Why?

398,4520,385376715,5,Reading books to my children is my absolute favorite part of our day,221 people found this helpful,"Reading books to my children is my absolute favorite part of our day.  Every evening and most rainy days, my two youngest children and I cuddle up on the couch and together we read stories.  Our collection is ever growing and I am always delighted to find a book that I am genuinely excited to add to our shelf.  Their current ages are three and five so we spend a great deal of time enjoying picture books.  We received our copy of ‚ÄúThe Wonderful Things You Will Be‚Äù by Emily Winfield Martin as a birthday gift.  This quickly became our favorite picture book and here is why‚Ä¶.Illustrations:Before even beginning the story, I fell in love with the whimsical illustrations.  The pictures are so unique, soft, precious and warm.  I found myself so captivated by the magical images on each page that I paused long after the words were read to absorb the beauty and detail. The children in the story are drawn with such care and each one is so individual and incredible.  It‚Äôs  almost too wonderful to keep on the bookshelf and deserves to be framed and hung on the wall.Originality:As I said before, we spend a significant amount of time reading in our family and it‚Äôs always a treat to find something completely new and original to add to our collection.  Emily Winfield Martin has blessed us with just that.  ‚ÄúThe Wonderful Things You Will Be‚Äù stands out in a category of its own by combining outstanding, one of a kind artistic beauty with an encouraging and heartwarming message.  There isn‚Äôt another book on our shelf that compares.  Her style is truly her own and greets readers with an individual experience they will want to reread over and over again.Message:The message of the tale is in the voice of a parent to their child.  It starts with the parent wondering aloud about who their young child will grow up to be.  From the very beginning, it portrays a strong message that, as a parent, they are certain that their child is someone they want to know.  Other children‚Äôs books do a great job of reassuring love between a parent and child but this adds another beautiful element to that message. Not only does it affirm that the parent will love the child, whoever they grow up to be, but it puts a great deal of excitement on all of the possible ways they can become their very own person.  It encourages adventure, taking care of others, individuality, wholesome character traits and creativity.  It says to go be everything you were created to be and I will love you with wonder and admiration.  What a powerful and uplifting message to children of any age.  Heck, what a powerful message for adults!Story Flow:When reading aloud, it is always enjoyable to be able to read a story with a steady, easy to follow flow.  This story is laid out in a comfortable progression of rhyming phrases without being sing-songy.  Each page contains a small amount of script while the captivating illustrations tell the story right along with the the written word.  The language is vivid, fun and adds character and creativity to this wonderful story.It Doesn‚Äôt Get Old:  I like Dr. Suess and admire his work, however, I can only read the tongue twisting silliness so many times before my head starts spinning.  How refreshing to have a story that you and your children can enjoy over and over again.  My kids have their favorite stories to listen to that aren‚Äôt always my favorites to read repeatedly.  It‚Äôs a blessing to have this book as a family favorite.  Each time I turn the page the kids point to the children in the illustrations and pick which one they want to be.  It‚Äôs an easy choice and enjoyable for all us.‚ÄúThe Wonderful Things You Will Be‚Äù has become my go to baby shower gift.  The last mom-to-be I gifted it to admitted to crying the first time she read it.  Perhaps it was just the hormones, but I venture to say that she truly appreciated the beauty and sincerity of this wonderful book.  Your family library is not complete without this gem.

She needs to meet an already extended deadline from her editor and focus on nothing but finishing her story.  She has recently inherited a house by the beach, and she is hoping it will present the perfect environment to get her creativity flowing through her fingers and onto her keyboard.Augustus lives in the beach house next door and he too is an author suffering from writer‚Äôs block.  He writes fiction with a bit more grit and there is usually no happy ending in sight, let alone romance.  He extensively researches the details in his plots and this can often take months.  He likes to dig as deep as he can and have the most accurate content in his finished work.They could not be more different writers but they do strike up a friendship of sorts and having a bit of friendly company over summer is better than being completely alone.  When they both realise they are suffering from the same writing affliction they come up with a plan.  Augustus will write a romance story, a genre he loathes after his own experience of a failed happy ever after, and January will write something a bit dark and real.

For some reason, not really sure what, I decided I wanted to get into reading.  I searched a lot of young adult fantasy books and finally decided on the Percy Jackson series.  I always enjoyed Greek mythology in high school and thought that Percy Jackson was similar enough to most of the other popular series but had the mythology aspect of it which made it unique.I got through all five books in about one month, reading for a few hours a night a couple times a week.  I honestly could not put any of these books down!  There are really no slow stretches, just when you think things are slowing down, BOOM something crazy happens and before you know it minutes turn to hours.  There is a good amount of humor in this series as well, not sure everyone who reads it will understand it, since it is geared towards a much younger crowd than myself.The Percy Jackson series is one that I will never forget.  An excellent blend of character development, friendships, action, adventure, suspense, humor...you name it, it is there!  I am not sure which book was my favorite, I would probably lean towards ""The Titan's Curse"" but all five books were excellent and I was sad to finish the series!This series is absolutely a lot of fun for all ages and all types of readers.

498,8206,1484707230,5,The Perfect Set For The Percy Jackson Fan...,7 people found this helpful,"If you are a fan of the Percy Jackson saga or know someone that is, then this is perhaps the perfect set of books to own or give as a gift.  I purchased the HARDCOVER set and the quality of each book in the set is fantastic!!What I love about the Percy Jackson saga is how the books are written.  Despite being for the 9-12 age group I find them just as interesting at 30.  Greek mythology has always been interesting to me and Rick Riordan brings it to life in spectacular fashion that could easily get kids hooked on the subject.  Despite being fantasy in design, the books have a nice subtle educational aspect to them; teaching you a little about Greek Mythology throughout the adventure.  Perfect for kids and adults alike I think.Without giving to much away, Percy Jackson and the Olympians is about a 12 year old boy named Percy Jackson who turns out to be a Demi-God (the son of Poseidon) who becomes aware of the hidden world of the Gods around him.  Each book follows Percy as he gets older and ventures out on a variety of adventures.  What is so great about these books is the style of writing Rick Riordan uses.  The books have very little filler and get right to the point.  This makes for constant happenings, and despite the biggest book being only 381 pages, there is more than enough action and adventure to go around.The books themselves, in the Hardcover set, are School & Library bound.  This means the books are extra tough.  The binding is exceptionally strong and the pages are also fairly durable compared to some other hardcover books I own.  I decided not to get the treasure chest and instead got the standard case for the books.  While it lacks the WOW factor the chest might give the packaging is still very solid.  It is laminated plastic that has the cover art for ""The Lightning Thief"" on the front.  It is sturdy as does the job of keeping the books safe and organized.OVERALL this is a great set for the Percy Jackson Fan.  The books are made with quality and durability in mind and the print on the books is clear and crisp.  This set would make for a perfect gift to a fan or add to a personal collection.  Rick Riordan struck gold with the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books, creating a wonderful story for both kids and adults.  This box set does it justice by giving each of the books the care and quality they deserve.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

The writing was okay, the character development wasn't deep enough and the ending was expected. Anyone who loves a good mystery must have been disappointed in the way this story came together at the end, it felt rushed as if the author was done writing and just needed to get this off to the publisher. The joy of reading is that there is always another book our there to enjoy and I will forget this one and move on.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH,-1,-1

Personally I have lost alot of repect for you as a writer for allowing this travesty to be released as book 9... I waited 19 years for a book that was supposed to be the book to end all books, literally. I have been a follower and lover of the wizarding world of Harry Potter since Day 1... My old paperback copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone has been read so many times its held together by tape... all 8 of my books are in some form of shabbiness due to the overwhelming amount of times each were lovingly read. I memorized almost every line, able to repeat the books almost from heart. Well yes 90% of my books on my shelves look like this. Harry Potter was and will always be my favorite series. Then this sad excuse for a story dare I say piece of crap shoved between two decieving covers, disguised as a book I was supposed to love just as much landed on my doorstep. I thought JK Rowhling respected her readers more then this. How could she have been so LAZY as too take a s***ty play written by someone else, slap her cover on, and sell it to her adoring and mislead fan base.

544,1976,786965606,4,The current edition is a good compromise of old & new,One person found this helpful,"Let's preface this with the fact that I'm old(ish). I'm 40, and when I started gaming in my childhood it was with folks a good 15-20 years older than me. So I started with a blend of original D&D, 1st ed., and pre-'players option' 2nd. ed. (which was in print when I started). Call it nostalgia or being stuck in my fuddy duddy ways if you like, but I've always preferred those editions to anything that came after for a variety of feel pretty solid reasons. 3.0/3.5 had its merits, as a totally different sort of game (less creative rules improvisation by groups as there were rules for EVERYTHING, and a system seemingly intended/designed for extremely high powered play with a lot of rules lawyering). I enjoyed it on those merits, for a different style of play. We'll ignore the trainwreck that was 4th ed. here, as we should.Which brings me to 5th ed. While I still miss TSR, I think WotC did a really good job marrying some of hard rules for customization, the scalable difficulty/rewards, and improved book layouts from 3.0/3.5 with a little more of the simplicity and ease of play of 1st/2nd. I think they could have gone a little farther taking systems back to the earlier editions, but I also realize they are *VERY* focused on organized, sanctioned, and tournament play, the portability of characters/players between them, and the idea of 'seasons' (something maybe they're trying to export from MMORPGs to draw in a new audience?). I'm sure this is a holdover practice from MtG. That sort of focus of course removes the possibility of house rules and discussion/negotiation/agreement between players for purposes of plugging holes in or otherwise altering rules. I'm not crazy about that direction for the product line, which cost them a star here. But in terms of production quality, value for the cost, and a thankful return to some recognizable systems and an abandonment of 4th ed., I think they've done pretty good job here.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

Too bad that both characters (he and she) had some fairly ordinary bad life experiences -- her father unfaithful to her mother -- his father really abusive. So how do those backgrounds and emotional baggage make this a Beach Read? Then there's the gloomy work that HE is doing to find out how cults work. Who cares? Go watch a TV documentary for that stuff -- not a romance novel. And its boring -- one thing I do is read on a tablet and can therefore track the percentages of pages read. I use this tool to find out if the writer is staying true to common, American novel, standards of internal story structure -- I know that's nerdy. BUT we want our sentence structures to conform to American English standards, and I want my story telling to conform to standard American novel standards.This book, Beach Reads, violates the common standards. For example, there's a movie term that describes common film standards: SEX AT SIXTY. Meaning that in a two-hour movie, lovers unit at the sixty minute mark.  Its also true of contemporary romance novels.  Romance readers have an expectation that lovers will unit somewhere around the middle of the book. Sadly, this book breezes past the key story turning point and thereby disappoints in terms of standard reader expectations.

596,8311,1484707230,5,"Really good book, teaches you some greek mythology, and offers you great entertainment.",One person found this helpful,"This review is by my 9-year-old son Anay.One reason why Percy Jackson is a really good book is that there are Greek gods and monsters. For example, in book 1 Percy meets Zeus, in book 3 he meets Dionysus, and in book 5 he meets the whole counsel. I think Greek gods are cool because they are powerful allies but make deadly enemies. For example, when Apollo and Artemis‚Äôs mother Leto was ambushed by a giant, she called them and they arrived and killed the giant. This shows how powerful and interesting the Greek gods are. Because there are Greek gods and monsters, you can even learn some Greek mythology which might come in handy in a history test. So Percy Jackson is sort of realistic fiction. Moving on, another reason why Percy Jackson is a really good book is that Percy has cool powers and stays in a cool camp. For example, Percy can control water, the camp has a cool armory and arena, and because he can speak to fish and horses. Percy is able to speak to Pegasus because Pegasus is part horse so he can ask Pegasus for help. Although Percy Jackson is a really good book because of Greek mythology and his powers and home, I think the most important reason is that he goes on an interesting quest in every book. For example, in book 1, Percy goes on a quest for the lightning bolt, in book 2 he finds the golden fleece, and in book 3 Percy finds the ‚Äúbeast‚Äù that can destroy the Olympians. The quests are really cool because a lot of adventure happens in them. All in all, I hope that I have convinced you that Percy Jackson is a really good book because Percy has cool powers and home, there are Greek gods, and most of all because Percy goes on an interesting quest in every book.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

625,1579,786965606,4,Mostly 3.5 with a sprinkling of 4th and a couple new concepts,55 people found this helpful,"So, I have been unable to find any useful reviews of the new edition of D&D.  I just wanted to know what this edition was like.  How was it different from 3.5?  How was it different from 4th?  I searched for reviews on Google, but was unable to find anything other than ""sneak peak"" articles that were months old or incredibly generic reviews.  So, now that I have begun to read my own 5th edition Player's Handbook, I can fill others in on what they want to know.First off, 5th edition is basically 3.5 with some ideas from 4th and a smattering of new stuff.  The Ability Scores are the same as they have always been, excepting that they cap out at 20 for mere mortals, and characters no longer get bonus spell slots for high stats.  The standard races are all present (humans, dwarves, elves, half-elves, gnomes, halflings, and half-orcs) plus the two ""new"" standard races from 4th edition, tieflings and dragonborn.  Most of the expected abilities for the races are still there, though there are no longer Ability Score penalties (though there are still bonuses).Darkvision and low-light vision have been merged into a single ability.  It's now the ability to see in dim illumination as if it were bright and in darkness as if it were dim illumination.  Pretty much everyone in the D&D universe besides humans and halflings has it. All of the standard character classes of 3.5 are present with the addition of the warlock.  There are no attack bonuses or saving throw bonuses gained directly through level advancement.  Instead, the class grants proficiency in armor, weapons, saving throws, skills, and tools.  The proficiency bonus starts at +2 and eventually gets up to +6 at level 17.  So, a 17th level fighter has a grand total attack bonus from his level of +6.  This is part of the 5th edition concept of ""bounded accuracy.""Characters get better as they get higher in level, but not nearly as fast as they used to.  One presumes that this will be balanced by monsters not getting quite as tough at higher levels as they used to, but the Monster Manual doesn't come out for another month, so we will have to wait to see.  But, the idea is that D&D characters in former editions became so powerful at higher levels that there was no question about whether they would succeed at their attack rolls or saving throws or skill checks.  To keep a little more uncertainty in the game, the designers of 5th edition did not want them to get that good.I haven't decided yet whether I like this or not.  I'll have to see it in action.  I have already thought about what I would do if I don't like it (if I feel that it limits the characters too severely), and the fix I would try first would be the 4th edition approach of adding a bonus equal to half the character's level to all attacks, saves, and skill checks.  But, I will give bounded accuracy a shot before I decide to ""fix"" it.Saving throws changed a little.  Instead of three types (Reflex, Fortitude, and Will) saving throws are now tied directly to an Ability Score, so there are six different types.  I'm not sure what kinds of things a Strength saving throw would be protecting you from (or Intelligence or Charisma, for that matter), but presumably there is a use for it.Some of the classes get a class ability at every level, while some only have them for about 12 of the 20 levels, and others fall in between those extremes.  Overall, though, it looks like the game designers tried to give more class abilities as characters go up in level so that characters have something to reach for within their primary class.  Characters can multi-class in 5th edition much as they could in 3.5, but the system looks like it tries to encourage remaining in a single class.Rather than skill points and skill ranks (from 3.5), 5th edition simply has skills your character is proficient at and skills he is not (like 4th edition's ""trained"" and ""untrained"" designations).  Some of these skills are determined by class, while some are determined by background (which everyone now has to actually pick).  The skills are few in number and broad in scope (like 4th edition).Feats are no longer an automatic part of the game, but must be paid for (if the DM allows them--but what DM wouldn't?).  They are slightly more powerful than 3.5 feats (and far more powerful than the anemic 4th edition feats).  So, how do you pay for feats, you ask?  At class levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19 your character's class ability is an increase in ability scores.  Either +2 to a single Ability Score of the player's choice, or +1 to two different Ability Scores of the player's choice.  If the alternate feat system is used, the player can give up the extra Ability Score points for a feat.Humans start off with a +1 to each of their Ability Score points as their sole racial ability.  However, if the feat system is used, there is an option for humans to start with +1 to three Ability Scores of the player's choice, one extra skill proficiency of the player's choice, and a feat.  I'd go with that in a heartbeat.  Just saying.Anyway, back to character classes.  Each character class also has several class abilities that are determined by a particular path that the character must choose (reminiscent of 4th edition's paragon paths).  Most of the character classes have only two or three paths to choose from.  Barbarians, for example, can take the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior.  Bards can belong to the College of Lore or the College of Valor.  Paladins can take an Oath of Devotion, an Oath of the Ancients, or an Oath of Vengeance.  Fighters choose from the martial archetypes of Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight.Two classes have many more options.  Clerics choose their path by choosing their domain.  There are seven domains defined in the PH: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, and War.  Wizards must select one of the eight schools of magic.  There are no longer generalist wizards.  All wizards must now be ""specialists"" (who are neither cut off from any schools of magic, nor gain extra spells from their chosen school, but who get other bonuses associated with the school in question).One presumes that the major feature of the first Player's Handbook supplement will be to greatly expand upon the path options within these character classes, as most of them are fairly limited at present.  Also, I would expect the backgrounds to expand significantly.  Currently, there are only 13.  When one considers all of the varied places in a fantasy universe his or her character could be from, only 13 possibilities seems remarkably limited.In addition to their earlier stated function of providing additional skill proficiencies for your character, backgrounds can provide languages and tool proficiencies.  They can also provide ""inspiration,"" a new 5th edition game concept.  Because backgrounds provide you with some personality traits for your character, DM's can now reward you for inspired role-playing by rewarding the character with inspiration.  You may then spend the inspiration to gain ""advantage,"" another 5th edition concept.When a character has advantage on any particular die roll (essentially, any d20 roll) the player rolls two dice and takes the better result.  When a character is suffering from disadvantage on a particular die roll, the player rolls two dice and takes the worse result.  Advantage and disadvantage do not stack.  That is, if you have advantage from multiple sources, you do not roll three or four or five dice--just the two.  However, they do cancel.  If you have both advantage and disadvantage, you simply roll one d20.Equipment can be purchased for the character in one of two ways: you can either roll for gold and buy your equipment ala carte, or you can simply take the equipment granted by your class and background (each contributes part of your equipment total).  Armor didn't change much, other than it has become somewhat simplified.  Light armor has no maximum Dex bonus.  All medium armor has a +2 maximum Dex bonus.  All heavy armor does not allow a Dex bonus (and most has a minimum Str requirement).  Also, most armor inflicts disadvantage on Stealth checks.I didn't notice any significant changes on weapons and tools, but then, I haven't looked at them too closely yet.  Likewise, I've only scanned the chapter on combat, but nothing was jumping out at me as being a radical departure from 3.5 rules.  It looks like the concept of being flat-footed is completely gone.  Damage resistance and vulnerability changed.  Instead of hard numbers, they simply halve or double the damage from the given source.  The 4th edition concept of short and long rests has been added.  Characters can roll a number of dice up to their total hit dice to spontaneously heal on a short rest, but do not get any of this dice pool refreshed until they complete a long rest (at which point, they automatically heal all damage anyway).Spell casting changed a little.  All spell casters are now, essentially, spontaneous spell casters.  Those casters who were spontaneous casters in 3.5 have really limited spell selection for their known spells.  Sorcerers, for example, start off with only two known 1st level spells.  They gain one known spell per level (usually--sometimes they skip a level), and they can add any spell up to the maximum level that they are currently able to cast.  At 17th level, sorcerers only have 15 total spells known (their maximum) for all 9 levels they can cast.Those spell casters who had to memorize spells in 3.5, now select a number of spells equal to their class level plus their main stat bonus from their spell lists (for divine casters) or their spell book (for wizards).  They can then cast these spells as many times per day as they have spell slots for just as spontaneous casters in 3.5 could.  They also have the advantage of being able to change this list of prepared spells every time they take a long rest.Spell casting also adds the concept of ""rituals"" from 4th edition.  Certain spells may be cast normally as spells or may be cast in a longer form as rituals (water breathing, for example).  The spell must be prepared already by the ritual caster (or must be in his spell book for a wizard), but does not count against the caster's daily limit of spell slots when it is cast in long form as a ritual.  And, there are many fewer spells in this PH than one might have expected.  That is probably something else that will change with the first release of a PH supplement.The cosmology of the D&D universe returned to the Great Wheel model of editions 1-3 with the addition of the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the Elemental Chaos (which now houses the individual elemental planes) from 4th edition.  Gods of from the pantheons of Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron (and the standard non-human deities) were listed, in addition to deities from the earthbound pantheons of Celtic, Greek, Egyptian, and Norse origins.  No full blown descriptions, mind you, just a single line entry in a list for each deity.Well, there you have it.  That is what 5th edition looks like.  If you loved 3.5, but hated 4th edition, it's probably worth looking at.  If you loved 4th edition and thought it was a major improvement on 3rd, you are going to be really, really disappointed.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,0,1

I listened to the audible version, which I recommend as he does speak (just short phrases) in various languages of South Africa so it was nice to hear the correct dialect.  He shares his story or growing up in South Africa during apartheid.  It is a real eye opener of racial prejudice at its worst and the effect it has on his mother and himself being a biracial child.

Many musicians have wild stories about crazy parties where anything goes, this is not one of those books. Instead this tale covers many of things in life that you may not expect it to. It begins with childhood tale of growing up and doing things kids do, but is mostly about life post Nirvana in my opinion. While he does tall some stories from those years, it‚Äôs more his take on how he got there and less about Kurt Cobain, RIP. While Kurt‚Äôs tale is a gripping one, you can find it easily elsewhere if by some freak of nature you aren‚Äôt already well versed on that part of the story. Tragic as it all must have been for those so close, this is a happier tale of the life and times of one of the greatest musicians alive and kicking. I have not enjoyed a book this much in a while, mostly only reading for the sake of learning. I wanted a light read that would be fun and this book delivers what I was seeking to find.I get a strong sense that I can relate to in this book. He is always very proud and thankful to have led the life he has, through each up and down as they came at him full force. He repeats throughout a feeling of disbelief at the places he had been and the things he has been blessed enough to experience in his life. Not that I ever had any other opinion of him, but you can tell he is truly one of the nicest and most humble musicians to tour the world. While luck may have played into it now and then, Dave really is where he is because of his amazing raw talent and his attitude towards the world and life. I would love nothing more than to spend a little time with this man just shooting the bull about music and family, things he is very passionate about for sure. He seems like none of his fame has gone to his head the wrong way and he should be very proud of what he has accomplished. Not many would have continued in music after such a loss as he must have felt, but we all have a great catalogue of music to enjoy because it worked out so well.The book has is more somber moments, the death of childhood friends, family, and band mates is enough to bring tears to most people I‚Äôll bet. Most tragic is knowing the entire time that following the release of this book his best friend and fellow musician Taylor Hawkins passed away while out on tour. It makes his pain seem much more impactful, but I‚Äôm certain he will once again pull through as he has been able to before. Each and every person he has lost would want nothing more for him than to continue down the road of success.All that aside, the highlights of the book for me are the way he describes his idols and meeting them, the way he describes his beautiful family, and his description of building his basement studio where some of his singles were recorded. Glad I‚Äôm not the only guy who nailed a sleeping bag or two to a wall for a little control over sound. Knowing that the first album for the Foo Fighters was recorded in a little home studio not that far off from the one I have built brings me in and helps bring the stories to life. His stories about Sir Paul McCartney playing with his daughter on the home piano and when he played for both McCartney and GW Bush are another high point for me. Dave might wonder how he ended up playing such a gig but I wonder how anyone else could be a better choice. I would be balling my eyes out if one of the Beatles was playing a song with my kid, but it‚Äôs no surprise he would be friends with Paul to me. I wouldn‚Äôt feel I was on that level either but Dave, you fit right in there.As a musician, however meek in comparison, a lot of his story is very relatable and hits home. I believe his mothers love snd support along with his taking life as it comes and not controlling every little thing made the difference between him and someone like me. That and the fact I would have been too scared to take such a chance at a young age as he did. Dave is a great person, it‚Äôs evident in the stories and how he tells them as well as from those I know who have met him and told their tales. Plus, it‚Äôs great to relate to him in that I play many instruments as well and value many things he values in life. He must have a blast touring the world and yet all the money and fame only seems to make him more humble and caring, which is something to aspire to for sure.Ever since I first heard him hammer his drum set into oblivion on Saturday night live I have known he was great and would achieve great things. I can‚Äôt wait to hear what happens next for him. Rock on, that‚Äôs all I can say. I will be reading this again and will then pass it on to my son to enjoy. What an inspiring man he is.Fully recommmend this to anyone who is a fan of music and life.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

There was definitely good chemistry between H/h and it was the promise of this thread that kept me reading.The writing was good but there was lots of repetition (so many references to crooked almost smiles and to the heroines hips)  and a good editor should have caught that.In all, this book was a bit of a mess and I recommend giving it a miss.

679,2392,1451673310,4,Fahrenheit 451,One person found this helpful,"Fahrenheit 451, was written by Ray Bradbury, and won the National Book Award. In this book, literature is forbidden and it is the job of the well respected firemen to destroy them and the houses in which they are hidden. This story gives you a sense of uncertainty, and has many plot twists. It is written in the perspective of an experienced fireman, Montag, who takes pleasure in seeing the houses and books be engulfed by orange flames. But a series of unexpected events lead him to question his past and even begins breaking the law himself.This story is set in the future, where the government has forbid literature in hopes to repress everyone‚Äôs thoughts and knowledge. Technology is advancing quickly and everyone needs to have the latest; entire walls made of one television screen. Hours upon hours are spent with the television ‚Äúfamilies.‚Äù The few who have any sense are seen as odd and deemed as outcasts.Montag begins as a typical fireman. He just follows the rules and goes on with his life, unmindful of what is happening in the world. Much like everyone else in the society. As the story progresses, he becomes more of a risk-taker. He starts to act for himself instead of for the good of society. Montag‚Äôs wife, Mildred, on the other hand, stays consistent with her characteristics throughout the story. She is more of a selfish, person who has been brainwashed by television. Mildred is an unpredictable character who seems to be in high spirits, but she tries to commit suicide, by eating too many sleeping pills.From the beginning of the story, you can tell that something is different in their society, as firemen burn down houses rather than put out fires. A significant event occurs right off the bat when Montag meets Clarisse, a young insightful girl who opens Montag‚Äôs eyes to the past when books were legal and people didn‚Äôt spend all of their time in front of the television screen. Clarisse meets Montag everyday in the same spot, on his way to and from work. They converse about the past and to Montag, she seems so wise and he immediately befriends her. After awhile Montag‚Äôs life begins to change, he doesn‚Äôt seem to know his wife anymore and he begins to doubt his all his previous knowledge. Pretty soon, Montag and Clarisse‚Äôs meetings become routine. But suddenly Clarisse wasn‚Äôt there to greet him on his way home anymore. She had disappeared and her whole family was gone. Montag and his wife are growing further and further apart. After the unexpected disappearance of Clarisse, Montag begins hiding books in his own home, hoping that they will help him to know what to do next.After a session with the fire captain, Beatty, Montag realizes why books were forbidden, simply to ensure that no one would be smarter than anyone else. The government anticipated that in banning books, it would repress everyone‚Äôs thoughts and ideas, so no one would be too smart. And they hoped to let technology pretty much brainwash people into believing that literature is not worth their time. So, by letting technology be dominant over literature, one will lose their knowledge. And the government‚Äôs plan worked, they‚Äôve created dumbed-down, technologically crazed clones. Montag refused to go to work for quite some time, but upon returning he made a new ally. Faber, a wise, old criminal, and Montag were fed up with the laws against books. The allies wanted to form a plan to rebel and legalize books again. They intended on planting books in firemen‚Äôs‚Äô houses and then call the alarm. Montag knew their plan was risky and that if caught; he would surely go to prison and maybe be put to death. Before he and Faber even began to fulfill their plan, they encountered an unforeseen delay. While Montag was at work one day, the firemen got a call for a fire, nothing out of the unusual, but when they arrived at the house it was Montag‚Äôs own house. Mildred had turned him in. Because Montag was now a criminal, he has to go on the run. Meanwhile, war has broken out in the community. I‚Äôll let you see for yourself how it ends.This book, because of the extensive detail, can be a little confusing at times. I would recommend it for older people. But, it‚Äôs very well written and I enjoyed reading it. It leaves you fearing a world with evolving technology and no literature.

It is definitely a suspenseful crime thriller, and is the first book in the Ella Dark FBI Suspense Thriller series. Ella is an FBI Intelligence Agent, but she wants to join the coveted Behavioral Research and Instruction Unit (BRIU). With a photographic memory and extensive knowledge of serial killers, their victims, and their cases, she gets the opportunity to join Special Agent Mia Ripley on a case in Louisiana. There have been three murders within one week. Is it a serial killer or multiple killers? How will Ella handle coming face to face with a real murder versus only seeing a scene through photographs and reports? Will she add value to the investigation or will she be a detriment?It was easy to connect with Ella Dark. She has a warm personality and a harrowing backstory, but lacks some self-confidence as she experiences her first case in the field. Overall, though, she‚Äôs a strong protagonist, and the author did a good job of giving her plenty of depth in this first novel. Mia Ripley, her partner, is an experienced field agent and works to mentor and train Ella. But will it be enough to help Ella survive? The reader also gets an occasional look at the killer‚Äôs thoughts and actions throughout the book. Who is it and what drives this person to kill?The writing flows smoothly and pulled me immediately into the story line. It is exactly what you would expect from a well-written crime thriller with plenty of action, lots of investigation, some twists and wrong turns and a gripping, spellbinding, thought-provoking conclusion. It was so full of action and excitement that it kept me turning the pages to find out what was going to happen next. I was kept fully invested in the investigation becoming a success. But is that what happens?Overall, this book was suspenseful, riveting, fast-paced, action-oriented, and entertaining. If you enjoy action crime thrillers that have strong female characters, then this may be the series for you.

756,17837,399587683,4,A good follow up to The Wedding Date,,"The reviews on this book strike fear in my heart as an author. I hesitated about leaving a review because I liked it but didn‚Äôt love it. But after reading some of the terrible reviews, I decided there needs to be more balance from people like me.I loved the diversity, the whole proposal scene, and the very empowering gym for women. I loved the characters‚Äô vulnerability. As a person who was in a verbally abusive relationship, it rang true that sometimes you don‚Äôt realize the full impact until you‚Äôre actually in a healthy relationship. I enjoyed that development.The dialogue was a little stilted for me, and I did think that the sex scenes could have used a little work (either skipping them and building the romance outside the bedroom or developing the detail during them). I would have liked some sexism in Carlos‚Äôs thought processes to have been addressed more directly once he voiced those thoughts.With that being said, I still enjoyed the story. I loved The Wedding Date, and this was a nice follow up. I think contemporary romance readers will enjoy it.",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH,1,1
