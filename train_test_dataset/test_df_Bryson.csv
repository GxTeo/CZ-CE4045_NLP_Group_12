Each entry left me thinking ""what does this tell me that the narrator hasn't already explained?"" It felt as though they were crafted by the narrator himself, vs. the character who I'm supposed to believe wrote them. My last and greatest disappointment comes from the fleeting attempts at symbolism & significance. The snowstorm, the Greek tragedy, and Amelia's artwork specifically.

But, I found out pretty quickly, that the hype was just hype and this book was pretty shallow. I really didn't care for any of the characters. They all seemed shallow and more like cardboard cutouts to me than real people of many layers and much depth. And the plot. Suffice to say it was outlandish. I don't really mind an outlandish plot if the writing's good and the payoff is worth it. In this case, however, the writing was about one notch below adequate, and the payoff, the big twist a lot of people say they never saw coming, was easily telegraphed to the reader in the first third of the book. By then, an astute reader pretty much knows how this book is going to end. Now, even though I love mysteries, and they make up about ninety percent or more of my fiction reading material, I usually can't guess the ending. In this case, however, I had no problem at all. I really can't give you any examples as to why, because if I did, I'd be giving you a spoiler, and whereas I don't mind spoilers, I know a lot of you do. So, you won't find any here. I can tell you, without spoiling the plot at all, that the book is inconsistent. In one section, the analyst, Theo, is told he can't have a cigarette lighter in the hospital because one of the patients could get hold of it and start a fire. Yet later, one of the patients is smoking and Theo does, indeed, have a lighter. There are several such inconsistencies in the book, so I think it needed a good editing. I might be able to overlook such things, though no reader should have to, if the story is compelling enough, but such is not the case with this book. Maybe this just isn't the author for me. I don't know. I certainly didn't like the short, choppy chapters and very plain prose, but some people might love those things. As I said before, I can overlook things like that if the story is a good one. This just wasn't. I don't think I'll be buying the author's second book.

The book is told in multiple points of view from the witness (Ella), the father (Henry), the friend (Sarah), and the private investigator (Matthew). Anna goes missing after taking a trip to London with her friend Sarah to go see Les Miserables. On the train they meet a couple of guys who were just released from prison. Overhearing the conversation, Ella feels uncomfortable for the girls but decides to stay out of the situation. After hearing the news of Anna‚Äôs disappearance she goes straight to the police to tell them what she heard on the train.A year later is when the story takes place. Anna is still missing and the family is getting ready to do an anniversary appeal to help get any new information. Ella, the witness, has been overwhelmed with guilt feeling as though this is partially her fault because she kept to herself and let the girls be. However, Ella's name was slipped to the media and now she has started to receive threatening letters in the mail accusing her of not helping. Sarah, the friend, feels as though this is her fault because she left Anna alone the night she disappeared and may have some inside knowledge on who may have known what happened to her. In order to give this information to the police, Sarah has to reveal a huge secret from her past but is she ready to admit to it? Henry, the father, had a big row with Anna right before she left but does his secret have anything to do with her disappearance? Matthew, the private investigator, is hired by Ella to help find out who is sending the letters but will he be the one to figure out what really happened to Anna?I Am Watching You by Teresa Driscoll was a successful novel but in a different way than imagined. From the description and title I was expecting a little more creepiness over the feeling of someone really watching Ella. Besides a few postcards and two incidents that happened at her flower shop, not much is touched on this subject. The majority of the book is trying to figure out what really happened the night Anna disappeared. I really enjoyed the different points of view because it brought fresh perspectives to the story as you continue to ask yourself what secrets are they holding on to? In the description on the book you are to assume that there would be more of this person ‚Äúwatching"" Ella and doing more to threaten her, or revealing that they know about Anna and what happened that night. From the novel you don't get much of this which was disappointing.Once you look past the disappointment of the main plot of the novel, the story and development were done well. I enjoyed trying to figure out what exactly happened to Anna that night and everybody's involvement. The story really does make you think, ‚ÄúWhat would you do?‚Äù Would you intervene if you were Ella on the train? Would you have revealed your secret if you were Sarah? Would you have lied to the police if you were Henry? All of these situations, the wondering, and the secrets kept me interested in the book.I give I Am Watching You by Teresa Driscoll 3 out of 5 stars. I was really disappointed with not having enough of the creepiness I was expecting of someone actually watching Ella and diving into that aspect of the book. The title and the description really had me wanting more than what was given. I did enjoy the story and the different points of view but felt it could have been a little stronger.

I managed to get the largest part of the hot glue off the bottom of the pages but there's still small amounts of glue over the bottom of the book making it difficult to open and making me fear that the pages would rip when I open one with glue still on the bottom.Other than that this book is perfect. Its a good base point for starting players and a good reference for even the more seasoned veterans of the game.

278,15757,1984806734,4,Terrific summer reading!,One person found this helpful,"Sometimes you pick up a book and it‚Äôs exactly what you need in that moment. And for me, Beach Read was it this week ‚Äî as evidenced by the fact that I read it in about a day and a half, ignoring the real-world obligations nagging for my attention.Beach Read is sweet and uplifting, but also a little heavier than you might guess from the title and the cover.Main character January is a young, successful romance writer. She‚Äôs known for her swoony love stories and happy ending. However, she‚Äôs been thrown for a loop, and isn‚Äôt able to summon her inner belief in the power of true love ‚Äî and her looming book deadline isn‚Äôt helping at all.January‚Äôs father recently died, so she‚Äôs dealing with the loss of her incredible dad ‚Äî but on top of that, at his funeral, she met That Woman. It turns out that her father had an on-again, off-again mistress for years, including during her mother‚Äôs battle with cancer. January is shattered and angry, and feels like her foundation has been swept out from under her. After all, it was her parent‚Äôs shining love story that taught her to believe in love-story-quality love ‚Äî and if that was all a lie, then what is she supposed to believe? And how can she possibly write a believable love story when she‚Äôs not sure her heart will ever be in it again?January‚Äôs father left her a beach-side bungalow in a small-town in Michigan. With her book deadline looming and a serious lack of funds, she decides to spend her summer writing at the cottage, while also cleaning, sorting, and getting it ready for sale. And the fact that this was her father‚Äôs place with That Woman is not helping in the slightest.Also distracting is her next door neightbor, who turns out to be the revered young writer Augustus Everett ‚Äî whom January knew as Gus back in their college days, when they were fierce competitors, and shared one steamy ‚Äúalmost‚Äù at a party.As January and Gus reconnect, initially with resentment and animosity, they realize they‚Äôre in the same boat when it comes to lack of inspiration and dire writer‚Äôs block. Gus is battling his own inner demons and past hurts, and he can‚Äôt seem to make progress on his next book.In the book‚Äôs central (cute) twist, they challenge each other to write each other‚Äôs genres. Gus has always mocked January‚Äôs belief in the HEA ‚Äî now, he needs to find a way to see the possibility of happiness, rather than going for the gloomy conclusion. And January needs to be open to grim reality and the idea that love isn‚Äôt always perfect, that messiness and secrets and hard choices are parts of life, and that fairy tales never (rarely) come true.Beach Read is so much fun, start to finish, but it‚Äôs not only sunshine and swooning. (But yes, there is swoon-worthy romance, to be sure.) The author has a lot to say about families and love, how the ideals of childhood can be tarnished by the realities of adulthood, how families can hurt one another but can also save one another in all sorts of different ways‚Ä¶ and how true love doesn‚Äôt mean no one ever makes a mistakes or hurts the other person, and that sometimes love takes work, compromise, and second chances.January and Gus have a great chemistry together, and I loved the scenes of them writing in their respective cottages, but communicating through notes held up to the window. It‚Äôs adorable ‚Äî so much better than texting!The small-town setting is charming, and there‚Äôs a wonderful bookstore, so that‚Äôs a plus! One of the central plot elements of the book is Gus and January‚Äôs series of field trips/dates, where each exposes the other to something that feels related to their own writing style and genre. So, line dancing alternates with going to the site of a tragic fire at a cult compound‚Ä¶ and all their excursions bring them closer to each other and also give them each different insights into their own process and emotions.The writing is cheerful and light, but the author doesn‚Äôt shy away from harder emotions. January and Gus both have baggage to deal with, and we do see their pain and confusion as they deal with the events in their lives and try to move forward.Bonus points too for a terrific female friendship, which helps January realize that true love can also be the bond between two lifelong friends who have each other‚Äôs backs and love unconditionally.""Falling‚Äôs the part that takes your breath away. It‚Äôs the part when you can‚Äôt believe the person standing in front of you both exists and happened to wander into your path. It‚Äôs supposed to make you feel lucky to be alive, exactly when and where you are.""Beach Read is a wonderful depiction of falling in love, but also a moving exploration of the messiness that comes with growing up and facing real life and accepting the fact that parents aren‚Äôt always perfect.As I mentioned at the start, this book came into my hands right when I needed it, and I enjoyed every minute.

In total it feel like updated D&D basic edition from the 80's. While character creation is streamline and quick the lack of customization that you get from 3d ed. and Pathfinder may lead veteran gamer to pigeon holed. Characters train skill options are VERY limited  and skills themselves are limited as well great for new player for vetran gamers you can feel like your character can not really grow and he advanced in levels but is lock into a few select main skills. The use of feats is even a optional rule as suck playing in a game with out them can maybe lead to feeling stifled and even if feats are being used its a trade off between increasing a ability score or the feat. this become a dilemma players with bad roll for those trying to make interesting, fun and even useful character.  As a beginner book its a great buy the book brings back the feel the D&D this is coming from a person the played since the Age of 10 at least. For player that prefer a more advanced game with more choices customization of your character I would give this a pass unless you want a book to help introduce a new players to gaming without some of the hassle that can come with a more complicated game like Pathfinder of 3.5.

Orwell's ability to stir fear and disgust in the hearts of his readers is extraordinary, and while I'm typically not a fan of sci-fi dystopian novels, Orwell's skill and prowess with the genre is both inspiring and refreshing to read.

And so on goes the string of 'good book review' words that one could easily associate with this novel. If you know what 1984 is, and if you know who George Orwell is, you don't need me to tell you to read this book. Because you should.But let's get over that, and dig underneath the book's paperdermis. Because yes, on the outside it appears to be the 1950s equivalent of 'the Matrix', a story laced with post-apocalyptic yet still relevant social commentary. But inside, 1984 proves to be much more valuable than that: this book perfectly captures the western political phobias and ideaologies of the World War II era.Orwell's 1984 was essentially Stalin's Soviet Union (made especially evident by the spot on physical similarities of Stalin and Big Brother, for one), but almost any totalitarian state fits the fiction. The state is ruled by the party, who control everything in life through the use of ignorance, propoganda and 'dissapearances' (purges). Sound familiar?When I first read this, I figured it was just the work of a paranoid British McCarthyist. But I was completely wrong. I came to realize that 1984 is a historical treasure worth reading, not because of the strangely convincing, yet absurd world of 1984, but because it recreates the western culture of the Cold War in an effective manner. This is not simply good fiction, but a bridge between the Cold War, and the political groups and ideas of today.

Then she finds herself spending the summer as a neighbor to her college--crush? nemesis?--Gus. He is a writer of Very Serious Fiction. Soon they have a bet. He tries to write a happily ever after. She tries to write literary fiction.After listening to a couple more somber reads that took me a little bit to get through, I breezed through this audio. It was fun and refreshing and exactly what I needed for a hot, punishing summer day. There are in-jokes for those deep in the literary world, but the book also doesn't relay on that world. These are complete people with very real hangups and dreams and fears.I like that these characters got to be messy. They felt real. They were dealing with some stuff, and if January has to sneak wine from her purse at a small-town thriller bookclub. Well, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.The romance felt more sweet than steamy to me (this is not a bad thing). I enjoyed it because we got some of the banter of a enemies-to-lovers plot with some unrequited crush and second-chance romance thrown in. Also, it was fun to imagine writer's critique flirting (probably because I do not do writer's critiques).If you're a fan of small-town charm in romances, this is also perfect for you. It had a lot of the same charm as the community in Well Met, or felt like the summer version of a Hallmark movie.It was interesting because at a writer's note at the end, Emily Henry talks about how when she talks about this book to other writers she talks about how its about writer's block. I'm going to sit with that. Both January and Gus are at transformative moments in their lives and faced with big decisions that have them paralyzed in terms of action. I think conceptualizing writers block within this framework is a fascinating idea.Also, for someone who rails against communication barriers as plot device in romance a lot, I feel the need to address that this does have some of that. However, I think this is an example of it done well. This isn't our characters refusing to address an issue or, god forbid, talk to each other. Rather, their communication issues always stem back to their own subconscious, how they fear the other is perceiving them. Their own real life baggage. What have you. I think all romances try this when we have communication mishaps, but it felt rooted here for me.Additional notable moment:""Just imagine what you'd do to me if I took you to a six-hour Jonathan Franzen reading.""""I cannot and I will not."" (punctuation approximate as I listened to the book.)I would definitely recommend this however you want to consume it as Julia Whelan is the narrator. It's going to be a great breezy read by the pool.

It's easy to see how Orwell extended the grim realities of the concentration camps of Germany and the labor camps of Russia into this dark prophecy. Of course, in many instances his vision has become realized. Big Brother seeks to invade our privacy at every turn via electronic media. Governments pose rhetoric immersed in ""doublespeak"". The Thought Police exist to bully our free expression. Power is exercised by imposing real human suffering upon multitudes. ""The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent."" Oil comes to mind here. And munitions. And diverse other commodities. In 1984 the war is endless. ""Everywhere there is the same pyramidical structure, the same worship of a semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous war."" Sound familiar? The High, or the ""priests of power"" only fall when assaulted by the Middle and usually assisted by the Low classes. Then the Middle becomes the High and oppresses the Low for which change only means a new master. The protagonist, Winston, a ""minority of one"" questions his own sanity but ultimately defends the ""spirit of man"" as a force which cannot be overpowered. In the closing pages we see Orwell's true convictions about the infallible power of Big Brother and the triumph of the human spirit. This dark view has real overtones of Nietzsche and Machiavelli, who wrote with the view of realism based upon the inhumanity they witnessed in their heydays by ""princes"" with the ""will to power"". But the ""spirit of man"" is truly formidable and cannot be overcome, except temporarily, by totalitarian figures and corrupt democracies. The next US national election will be telling about down which road America will travel. 1984 is a cautionary, post-World War II tale but to say it's unrealistically dark and couldn't happen here and now is to overlook eons of history. And to be unconscious of the powers of orthodoxy infringing greedily and corporately upon the spirit of man in our time.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,1,1
309,5731,670062510,4,Review of SE Hinton's Outsiders,2 people found this helpful,"I read this book because my 13 year old daughter was reading it for 7th Grade English.  I like reading the same books as my daughter, so we can discuss the book together (and hopefully encourage her to read more!)My daughter absolutely loved the book!  She would have given it 5 Stars!  I do think this book is enjoyed more by someone her age (young teen) than someone my age (adult).  A younger person has not been exposed to the million books/stories/movies that have overused the ""greasers versus the socs"" type theme.  I believe the theme may have been unique, back when the book was first written, but now it is exhausted.I am also blown away that a 15/16 year old girl wrote this book!  Amazing!  Although the writing was not perfect, the fact that it was written by a teenager, about teenagers, gave the book more authenticity.  BUT, it only took me reading a few pages of the book to Google what S.E. Hinton's full name was, I thought the author had to be a girl!  It is challenging when the narrator of the story is a boy, and the one writing the story is a girl.  I have a 17 year old son.  Seeing that Ponyboy was a gymnast, a lover of Robert Frost poems, a fan of Gone With the Wind, and at his young age loved sunsets, didn't seem realistic for a rough-and-tumble teenage boy!  That said, Ponyboy's vulnerability gave a bite the story needed in to pull at your heart strings.This story is a classic.  I am glad I read it.  I believe it is best suited for young teenagers.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block.Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts.ReviewThis was an easy and light read.  I don‚Äôt read much romance anymore ‚Äì but I would definitely characterize this book as one.  The characters were likeable and the story was good. I was vested in the characters and I wanted to find out where they came from and where they ended up so that was a huge plus for me.The 2 main characters met in a writing class several years prior to where they ‚Äúre-meet‚Äù in the book.  By the time the reader meets them, they are both successful writers in different genres.  January is a stereotypical super emotional romance writer, and Gus is a stereotypical emotionally stunted literary fiction writer.  As people as mentioned in previous reviews I‚Äôve read, there was a lot of crying, like, a LOT of crying.  I am happy to say though that characters were able to own up to their weaknesses so that I forgave their annoying qualities  There were definitely funny lines in this and I definitely love humor in a book.I just think that‚Ä¶ nothing really happened.  January and Gus spent time  interviewing and researching people from a cult‚Ä¶and then the book briefly mentioned Gus wrote it in his new book.  The book spoke lightly about some abuse in Gus‚Äô past, but left it hanging.  The one person in the book you were sure you were going to hate, you learned to understand and maybe not forgive, but understand.I am not a huge fan of books wrapping up perfectly, but I would say this was still worth the read.Favorite lines:‚ÄúHe fit so perfectly into the love story I‚Äôd imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life.‚ÄùJanuary ‚Äî Beach Read by Emily HenryTwo hours hadn‚Äôt given me closure, but it was time I‚Äôd never expected to have with him.

The vibrant, noisy, entirely wonderful Petropolous family lived next door, and Macy and Elliot became instant friends. Over the years, their friendship slowly became more. Elliot became Macy‚Äôs first kiss. Her first love. Her first time. Then, in one horrific weekend, Macy‚Äôs life is ripped to shreds.Ten years later, she‚Äôs a resident in critical care pediatrics. She‚Äôs engaged to an older man. She has a couple close friends, but she‚Äôs never really let anybody new into her life. Not for real, and not after what happened with Elliot. And then she sees him.

392,122,451524934,5,The Power of Language,4 people found this helpful,1984 is the classic novel detailing a new world conceived in the 1950‚Äôs which is a hybrid mixture of Nazism and Communism taken to the ultimate degree.  It is about a world in which the everything is controlled by the state. It is about a world in which every action and reaction is controlled and monitored in every way.  In fact your thoughts were monitored by the thought police and the language changed slowly to where good means bad and war is peace. This use of language is why I reread this classic book because this way thinking about language is something we see and face today in the United States.  Kellyanne Conway in an interview made the statement that she had alternate facts.  What does that mean?  That statement makes as much sense as ‚Äúwar is peace‚Äù which was the nonsense being propagated by Big Brother in 1984. This type of language takes hold throughout the theme of the book just as the language of the Third Reich took effect during their 12 year reign of terror as explained in Victor Klemperer book titled The Language of the Third Reich. The power of language can in fact guide one‚Äôs political acumen.,True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

The uniqueness of your genetic origins, the place and time of your birth, your keen powers of observation, the diversity that your mother exposed you to and your superior storytelling abilities have all come together to create a fitting parable at a time in history when good ones are so dearly needed. If you will excuse my expression, it is a wonderfully colorful tale for our time.My review specifically avoids your detailed descriptions of the hardened environments that you endured and the weight of your experiences in growing up under such circumstances in order to not distract from the charm of your personal style that always carries the day.

I borrowed it from the library when this is one that 100% deserves to be purchased.It was utterly wonderful. I adored this book! I love the MCs imperfections. I loved that they knew each other but not really years before. I loved that he was smitten with her back in the day! (I honestly skipped ahead and found this out, but I didn‚Äôt even care because it made him so much more endearing.) It's 1st Person, FMC's POV, slow burn, dare I say, grump/grump trope? The romance was so sweet. It was subtle in the perfect places--the kind that is begging to be reread so you can soak everything up. This is a book that lived up to the damn hype, and I have almost no complaints.This book is absolutely Women's Fiction though. This is not a romance. This has a heavy romance, no lie, but this is Women's Fiction with Romance. The author mentions in the acknowledgments that she tells other writers that this book is about writer's block. Not the romance. It's also very wordy. Like, overwritten, over described, heavy inner monologue which really speaks to women's fiction more than romance as a genre. The plot of them switching genres begins on page 80 of 360ish, so it's a very slow moving plot. But it is incredibly developed. The A plot mixes seamlessly with the B and C plots. You can't have one without the other and I really appreciated that. The plots are also really heavy, again, more women's lit than romance.The back story is really told, not shown, but it is told in a more compelling way than straight true info dumping, and it's told it a beautiful manner. I felt like some of the chapter endings were random. Like, oh crap, gotta cap this chapter now and start the new one. It wasn't distracting too much; it just felt weird. Weirder though, was the choice to have sex--multiple times--outside of a burned down cult site. Like, MMC brought condoms for that outting when he hadn't had them for their other sexytime. So. It was clearly a choice. Unless they stopped using condoms, but given the mention of them . . . it just wasn't the sexiest choice in the world.I loved this book. I'm really looking forward to reading more from Ms. Henry. And I can't wait to buy the book myself and reread it.This one lives up to the hype.",True,romance,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

This is one case where I'm glad I stuck it out. The beginning of this book was honestly a bit unbearable, I had gotten the picture and message of the main points (conditions, environment, authority figures, main character development) within the first 40 pages or so and everything after was just rehash after rehash...But then, roughly half way through the book, it had gotten so interesting, so good, and so insightful, that if it had taken me three weeks to read the first half, it took me all of two days to finish the second half.The authors account of war and his ""counter view"" of the world he himself set up was flat out awesome. He cleverly delivered a thorough analysis of war and society through the guise of educating the lead character, and subsequently further demonstrated his points by breaking the main character. I'm sure there are plenty of reviews before mine that do a much better analysis and description of the themes and techniques of the book, and why both were done extremely well, so if this review is meant to dive any one point home its to those with a short attention span.Give this a chance.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

533,2351,1451673310,5,A Must-Read for Everyone,,"""A little learning is a dangerous thing...shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, and drinking largely sobers us again."" - Alexander Pope Curiosity and learning were foreign concepts to Montag, a book-burning fireman. But that was before Clarisse, before the books. No longer able to stay blissfully ignorant of the wrongs of the society around him and the misery of the people so engrossed in their technology, he begins his journey for knowledge. But how far is he willing to go? Ray Bradbury sobers us with the world he creates, leaving us to wonder - could our future be heading down the same path? With odd and many sided characters, such as Mildred who calls television actors her family during the day and downs sleeping pills at night, the book refuses to be put down. In his book, Bradbury proves that knowledge lives on long after it is created; even when the source is gone, things can still be remembered and often still ring true. Within a single novel, hard to find in this day and age, a story that transcends time is found, one where you hope and worry for the protagonist. Is there any chance of success against government as a whole and is rebellion and knowledge worth it? That's for you to decide after reading this book. For we are taught that, though knowledge sobers us, we must be sober to be ourselves. With an unpredictable ending and realism not found in most books today, you will regret it if you miss this book. But wait until you are ready to decipher it, because symbolism is found everywhere, from salamanders to people.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

I loved the slow build, I loved the tiny pieces each chapter gave until the end when we find out the biggest piece of the plot and it makes you understand. I took off half a star because I felt after that slow burn, the book went from 0 to 100 in a span of two chapters which left me feeling a bit bereft. I wanted more of the present!I am not a stranger to Christina Lauren's writing styles, this duo nails every single book I have read by them and each book is similar but different in their own ways. Sometimes reading author's books can be redundant because they feel like all the others but I do not have that problem with this duo!This book was so heavy in certain spots and so emotional but it was also light hearted, humorous, and gave me so many amazing feels! I was on the edge of my seat at one point just wondering where this story was going. I normally do not appreciate the past to present narrative but this one worked. Sometimes the past got so heavy that the present more than made up for it and vice versa.Elliot was everything! Intelligent, sophisticated, caring... just everything! Macy was hard to like but I understood her struggle, which really kept me going inside her mind. Past Macy was better than present Macy but it eventually worked out and I began to enjoy both.

670,5761,670062510,5,Reminiscent of West Side Story,One person found this helpful,"Conflict, violence, death and gangs are the main themes of Ponyboy‚Äôs story but the life lessons are priceless.  Overall, I declare this book an inspiration for both male and female readers.  There are male and female issues addressed and male and female heroes portrayed.  I respect how all parties involved express sorrow and frustration over the petty fighting and classist mentality.  I feel this is another real world connection as gangs and petty fighting are rampant among today‚Äôs youth.  I find the fashion references endearing ‚Äì how teens were (even back then) obsessed with their hair and just the right outfit and how the notion that clothes can truly define who you are is still alive and well!  I adore S.E. Hinton‚Äôs creative characters names; Sodapop, Ponyboy, Cherry, Two-Bit, Mickey Mouse, etc.  I hope readers will catch on to Cherry‚Äôs declaration that, ‚Äúthings are rough all over‚Äù and, more importantly, to the importance and benefits of structure, discipline and consequences as noted when Randy stated that Bob‚Äôs poor choices were a mere cry for attention from his parents.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH,1,1

I also grew up watching some of these shows and had no idea what was going on behind the scenes,let alone what some child actors have to go through just to give the rest of us entertainment. This book sheds a light on Jennette‚Äôs struggles with eating disorders and her tumultuous relationship with her mother and the effects of how it spilled out in every other aspect of her life. I bought and finished this in one day. I would absolutely recommend reading this if you have even a slight interest in it.

Both were full of wonderful facts about the story, but I kind of wish I had skipped the intro until the end. Bradbury‚Äôs worlds exist on their own, the familiar and real infused by magic or danger, and surrounded by the darkness and woods that separate them from our civilization. I don‚Äôt want to tie them to anything other than my own memories of the past and dreams of the future.

This new edition, though, actually kind of excites me. I'm really very much interested in starting to run it, which I wasn't with 3rd (though I grew to love it) and really wasn't with 4th (which I didn't care for at any point, and which doesn't really have much to do with 5th except for a few concepts like rests and some at will type of powers.) There's a lot of things to like here, with a ton of stuff from 3/3.5 being simplified and a lot of feat-based stuff being incorporated directly into classes or just made accessible to all.
