Having grown up with Harry Potter and having created the characters in my own mind to such a degree that the events that happened seem like memories of real events, it was like eating your favorite comfort food only to suddenly find out all the original products used to make it are no longer available and the current dish was made with artificial products that have the same name but none of the same qualities. The story line is interesting, but very complicated. It was not given the amount of depth or respect necessary for the plot. Very, very disappointing.

The premise was interesting, and it started off strong/unique, but after about the halfway point I realized the story was going in a completely different (and very predictable) direction. The relationship between the main character and the best friend was well developed, but the relationship between the main character and the 'other man' felt so rushed and completely out of the blue. I won't spoil the ending, but it left me very upset with both the lack of respect, the sudden turn of events, and the unexplained complete absence of emotional connection.

I first read ""1984"" in 1985 and now for the second time in 2018.  The book has remained the same, but both the world and I have not.  I cannot begin to convey how genuinely frightening this book is.  I am a lover of popular science fiction and am astounded by Orwell's ability to be more compelling, entertaining and engrossing than authors with the benefit of light sabers, phasers and teleportation.To every young person who has been assigned this book, know that you are reading a literary work of art.  Many of you will understand and appreciate it, but if you love literature, please make a mental note to read this again when you are older.  Youth brings with it eternal hope, boundless optimism and of course, hormones, so you will find yourself rebelling against the pessimism of the book itself - you will effectively be Winston raging against the machine, hoping, searching, questing for a way out.  In short, you will cheat.But when you get older, have a family, lose loved ones and see some of your dreams unfulfilled - when you witness entire nations and races of peoples born, live and die in brutal squalor - when you reflect on the technological advances made over the decades and gaze, with mouth agape, at how a people can be less advanced, less informed and less enlightened, not despite these innovations, but BECAUSE of them, then you will read 1984 as it was meant to be read...not as a dark, dystopian world you enter when you open the book, but a beautifully brutal warning that, even as you read it, is prophetically coming true around you.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

Well my dears, put away your knives and forks. There is no steak here. There is, however, plenty of sizzle, or whatever you might like to call the overabundance of hot air surrounding this sad little tome. Like many others who've reviewed this work, I too fell for the hype. The ""Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller!"" and ""Instant...Hollywood-bound...new thriller!"" I, too, fell for the shouted headlines and the scare quotes that strained mightily to assure us, the readers, that this book was It. The New Big Thing. A Must-Read. Unputdownable. Well, I'm an author myself. I'm also a college English teacher. And I have many years of experience in all aspects of the book trade, from submitted manuscripts through to finished -- marketed -- products. I've edited for the so-called ""Big Five"", and let me tell you: this book is capital-b BAD. My reaction upon reading it (didn't finish; maybe got 75% of the way through) was ""How the h-e-two-sticks did this ever get past the acquisitions editor????"" (I've done acquisitions, too.) Where to begin? Off the top of my head, (1) the writing is appalling - immature, stilted, flat, with far too much telling and not enough showing - and the author has an MA from Cambridge??? Wow. (2) the story doesn't make any sense (3) the attempted explanations for the pitiful plot are illogical in the extreme (the man she saw was Theo and he's the one who -- well, I won't give it away, even though in this case it hardly matters.) (4) the author's knowledge (I use the term loosely) of psychiatry and psychiatric illness is pitiful. The caveat that ""borderlines are seductive"" is repeated ad nauseam, yet I don't recall Alicia ever being diagnosed with such - never mind that most mental health professionals nowadays hesitate to affix the 'borderline' label because of its enormous stigma. (5) the 'celebrity' endorsements - how the frilly heck did that happen? I mean, please, tell me. Because for the life of me I can't figure it out. This is just a really, really, really bad book. Avoid it like the plague. If you have purchased it, and if - heaven forfend - you have read it, I recommend a calming glass of some nice vintage, surrounded by those who love you and are willing to offer emotional support.

I no longer had the time and the idea of dedicating my little free time to even more reading made no sense to me and filled me with dread. I'm now a recent college graduate and this is the first book I've read in my free time in years. I tore through it in four days, and it would've been less had I not been working.Jennette is an incredibly skilled writer. She has a command over words that is gimmick-less and true. She simply writes things they way they are and the way she sees them, and it is incredibly striking. She writes of events in her life that resonated deeply and miserably with me, and events that struck me with horrified, disgusted awe--behaviors so unimaginable that it horrifies me this came from a place of reality. Needless to say, I was often in tears reading this.[Mild and non-specific spoilers below.]Towards the end, I was crying because of just how proud of Jennette I was. Reading of her finally craving a grip on her life, creating a healthier relationship with control, developing boundaries, regaining herself--it all struck me with an intense sense of joy and sheer pride. I can only imagine the strength this journey took--not just writing the book, but reliving the memories, and all of the processing and recovery that came before it.I'm left wanting more. What I'm personally interested in (and what have loved to read) was an expansion on how she came to terms with her mother being abusive. I don't imagine her revisiting this topic in a book, though, so perhaps I'll look to interviews. Regardless, I look greatly forward to whatever she puts out next. I am certain she will make it magic.Overall, a fantastic read for those who can stomach the intense, vivid, and plainly-stated. Thank you Jennette for bringing yourself peace and sharing that with us. And a personal thank you from me for letting me love reading again.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

26851,133821666X,1.0,Wish I had a Time-Turner to Unread This,6,"*Some spoilers* I get that this is a script for a play and that you need to SEE it to really get into the world of Harry Potter again. I get that there are new characters and I am asked to get to know and love them from a bare-bones script whereas I spent years learning and loving the original characters. What I DON'T get is why almost every one is so damn unlikable. Albus is as annoying as Harry circa Order of the Phoenix with his angst. Ron--on paper--is a caricature of his former self: his corniness is highlighted in a less than enduring way, his mediocrity more glaring than ever. Hermione seems to be an ineffective leader and hardly believable as the head of the magical world. Harry is just--awful, just awful. Draco suddenly became overly emotional and unlike the haughty, cold British boy I loved before. Scorpius is the saving grace and pretty much the only likeable person. And then there are the glaring plot holes...why is Cedric Diggory only one awful event away from becoming one of the worst people ever? His honor, valor, chivalry, and fairness are what his character was about--so one bad day turns him into a demon for all time? No. Unconvincing. Why--WHY--if the Malfoys had real Time-Turners, wouldn't they have gone back and achieved their plans before? Or if they acquired them after Voldemort's fall, they still could have gone back in time and made Draco a hero--which is befitting of their prideful ways and would have been pretty interesting. The love-child with Bellatrix and Voldemort is just wrong. Of course we knew Bellatrix was panting after him, but Voldemort seemed to be apart from lust of any kind for a woman. It is just awkward and disgusting. It also seems like Bellatrix would have piped up about such a thing prior to the war, or even any of the Malfoys. It also seems that the baby would have been made into another Horcrux if she was so top secret. Finally, perhaps the most annoying thing of all to me, is the just plain weirdness of some things. There seems to be a lot more SPOKEN emotion in the play. In all 7 of the original books, none of the characters say ""I love you"" or anything. Their love is implied and demonstrated in their actions and this somehow makes it more realistic than mushy words, however in this play they are all about the mushy sentiments and it is just out of character for them. And there is this one scene with Albus--who is 14--disguised as Ron with the aid of polyjuice potion is trying to distract Hermione from going inside of her office and is practically making out with her and actually says he wants to have another baby with her. Ew. I would see the play if I am ever in London, or if it travels to the US, but only to see if it redeems itself somehow in some measure. It will never be right or perfect and I wish I had a time-turner so I can unread this crap and go back to platform 9 3/4 to see a bright-eyed 11 year old Albus off on the train and leave the saga there.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

I still have my memories of enjoying the original books and films but reading this trash truly upset me.

Then you receive the actual product and learn the truth. The script is thin and double spaced. It lacks the ability of the Rowling books to draw you into the story.

Subclassing is a great way of putting tons of variation into character creation. Even though there are only technically 12 classes, with each class having at least two subclasses, traditions, circles, orders, domains, colleges, schools, etc. there's closer to 40 options for builds just in the class selection. Top that off with most classes having some form of access to magic and the ability to multiclass easily (no penalties to multiclassing like in 3.x and multiclassing isn't as useless as in 4e), and the classes are entirely solid in this PHB.Races have a similar amount of selection as classes do, with many races having some sort of subrace(s), the exceptions being humans, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings. Dragonborn have subraces in the form of choosing the color of scales and the breath weapon associated with that, but their subrace variant isn't exactly variant in itself.Equipment, feats, etc. is all pretty well detailed. The trinkets table is interesting as well.The book itself is well made. The art is good and abundant with lots of detail put into it.

They wouldn't be friends because he wouldn't give them what they wanted. So, they turned their backs on him until he was so lonely that he gave away his prized possessions just so they would be friends with him. How is that a good lesson? It isn't about sharing, it is about not accepting yourself for who you are and demanding that others give you what you want. It isn't about friendship, it is about bullying.

I don't get what is violent about this book and I think the person who rated this book as ""Horrible and Violent book"" does not really understand the book.1. The reason why the story tells a boy(Johnny) getting abused by his father is to tell the readers that Johhny would never know what the love and affection are without his buddies.2. The boy(Ponyboy) was getting drowned by the ""Socs(Socials)"" because Ponyboy and Johnny was a ""Greaser(Hoods)"" meaning they were like Criminals(junivile delinquents) and that's how people look at Greasers, while people like Socs because they have clean hair wearing madras shirts and riding corvairs and stuff.3. Ponyboy mentioned ""Electric chair"" because an incident happened and he was terrified that they'll get a bigger consequences than Socs because they're Greasers. Johnny killed a Soc with a switchblade because Ponyboy was getting drowned by a Soc and Bob(one of the Socs) scared Johnny to kill him. Johnny also killed Bob because he's the one who nearly beat him to death and left him at the lot(flashback).4. Johnny and Ponyboy hurried and left the scene, and went to find Dally(one of their buddies). He was in a party and when Dally told them that he was sleeping in a bed, he also mentioned that he was actually(literally) sleeping, doing nothing else.5. Sodapop(Ponyboy's older brother) had a girlfriend named Sandy, and he wanted to marry her but she left him because he was a Greaser and didn't even graduate highschool. Not because she was pregnant. Sodapop really liked her but she didn't realize that his feelings were true.6. A girl named Cherry was also a Soc, and got in the car with other Socs not guys. She got in a car because one of them was her boyfriend and she couldn't stand fights(The Socs called Greasers in a mean way and Ponyboy's buddy Two-Bit held his switchblade and gave Ponyboy a busted glass bottle). You also can realize that even though Cherry is a Soc, she isn't mean to Greasers like other Socs.7. When Ponyboy and Johnny met Dally and told him what happened, he told them there was a old Church at Windrixvile and that they can stay there while things are settled up. The church one day caught on fire and Ponyboy and Johnny tried to save the kids. Ponyboy was able to get out of the burning church but Johnny passed out before he got out of the church.Ponyboy was fine, One of Dally's arm got little burned but he was okay, Johnny's back was broken and he had a bad burn and eventually died.8. When Dally heard that Johnny died, he couldn't take it because he loved Johnny so much(like a brother) and broke in a store and got shot by the cops because that's what he wanted.9. Also Johnny once said to Ponyboy that he wants to kill himself but while he was in a hospital dying, he told Ponyboy that he doesn't want to die anymore. Johnny thought dying at age of 16 is not enough and wanted to learn more things in his life.It's an awesome book if you know the meanings of the popular quotes such as ""Stay gold ponyboy, stay gold"" meaning good things also has an end to it(I think) and it's also helpful to review the poem ""Nothing gold can stay"" by Robert Frost.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

Will has always come off as ""annoying"" to me and the first several chapters let me understand WHY. It's just who he IS. Initially, I was turning pages like lightning, at times laughing out loud and at others shaking my head at his profound ""corniness"". The stories were fun, interesting, and insightful.  His cockiness is present from the beginning, but not necessarily bothersome. Then, about halfway through, he takes a nosedive...The light-hearted story of Smith's life morphs into a self-important bragathon which is very hard to read. I didn't realize Will is SO full of himself! My goodness, there's one thing to be confident or competitive even, but this guy is downright arrogant! So many times, I've closed this book and put it to the side (because he was simply getting on my nerves).Another thing I didn't enjoy was the inssecant need to dumb things down. As a Philly native, it was nice to know most of his references to the city. However, the constant explanations of words and phrases was unnecessary and often condescending. I don't know much about Mark Manson but I imagine the many self-help/psychoanalysis portions are from him. I could do without these as they don't sound genuine and disrupt the natural flow.It seems the intention was to inspire and/or uplift, but to have the desired effect, Will Smith seriously needs a lesson in humility! I suppose it could possibly come at the very end as I have been 360+ pages in for months now and just can't finish the darn book!

Then I was lucky enough to see him perform in Jan 2015 at a local comedy club in my area. The show was packed but not many people knew who he was or even cared. After that show I told everyone that he'd be the next big thing and even posted it on my Facebook timeline. As it turns out, Jon Stewart must've had similar thoughts after he saw video of Trevor performing. Fast forward a few years and Trevor is taking America by storm.As a longtime fan, I'd heard about some of the stories contained in this book. I'd seen his (2011) documentary, You Laugh but it's True and read countless interviews over the years. I, however, had no idea that he was raised by such a phenomenal woman and that he'd faced such adversity during his childhood.I LOVED this book. I first purchased it on kindle but decided to download the audio version after discovering Trevor narrates it himself. He's a natural storyteller. Listening to his voice heightened the experience tenfold. I laughed with him, cried, became enraged, sad and happy... his words and stories resonated with me.

Fortunately, it was also an incredibly useful one. Very quickly got used to character creation, and helped players do the  same.The only thing I would have liked would be reorganizing the list of spells. Spell lists are presented in order of what classes can learn which spells of  each level, but the spells themselves are organized alphabetically. This means there is much more page turning required when you still haven't memorized what spells do. While I understand why they did this (simplicity probably being the biggest reason) at least separating everything into spell levels would be INCREDIBLY useful.Since I bought this, I've picked up the rest of the core rules, as  well as both Xanathar's Guide to Everything and Volo's Guide to Monsters. For people starting off, I'd recommend the Player's Handbook wholeheartedly.

7768,1984806734,3.0,Unusual romance tale - steamy yet brainy & heartwarming,,"I didn’t go into this book expecting a lot, but I was a bit intrigued by the description, I’d seen it mentioned a lot, and, hey, it was a good price for the Kindle version on Amazon when I was feeling bereft of good books.At first, wow, I was so pleasantly surprised. Well, at the ‘very’ first (5 or 10 pages or so) I was wondering whether I could continue or not because of the sad-sack, disjointed story and just not feeling connected with the protagonist or the situation or the few people mentioned, etc.However, I said to myself, c’mon, you’ve got to at least give it fifty pages, right? So I kept going. And I was glad I did, because at about 20 pages in, it started taking off and sucking me in. Ah, I thought, now it’s a story about an author, and not just one but two!I enjoyed the part about writing and not writing, about how other things in life can distract a writer. I even enjoyed learning why January was in such a bad place in her life and I loved the setting on Lake Michigan, and I loved the old-crush-university-hot guy who she (miraculously) reconnected with.I really loved the story with all of its nuances and quirks of locale and characters and gaining an understanding of the backstory of why the main characters were wary and hurt and struggling.I even enjoyed the sexy scenes, wow, they were hot without being too explicit, which I appreciate. I liked the romantic aspect of things as well, like being drawn to someone for other reasons than just their hotness.What dragged me down as a reader was the inevitable devolution into the damn romance novel trope of getting closer, backing away, almost there, then there’s a misunderstanding, doubts and fears and then getting close again. Almost having sex and then the damn backing off. It was too much.I did love the ending, who wouldn’t, but I would have preferred that the themes of writing and viewpoints about life be more fully developed rather than just dissolving into the typical romance novel clichés.However, I do recommend this book because it was a damn good ride and I enjoyed the characters and their steamy, yet real, connections as they worked through things and and got through to each other.",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH

11294,451524934,5.0,Great story of a government granted unlimited control over its citizens,One person found this helpful,"""1984"" by George Orwell is a great novel about what happens when a government becomes consumed with power. The story takes place in London in 1984 which was in the future when the book was written. London is part of a country called Oceania. The main character is called Winston.Oceania is continually at war with either Eurasia or East Asia. Once Oceania makes peace with one of those countries and goes to was with another it pretends in its government propaganda that it was always at war or at peace with whatever country it is at war or peace with.The majority of the population in Oceania are Proles who are like a peasantry. The elite people are only allowed to have sexual relations for the specific purpose of producing children but the Proles are freely allowed sexual relations.The citizens are kept under almost constant watch by camera-like screens. Writing in a diary is not allowed.This novel depicts a future where there are almost no human rights granted citizens. There is no privacy. Anything people do is known by the government. In our modern world so far this hasn't happened in the country U.S. where I live. Due to knew technologies which could give the government a greater ability to watch its citizens there is a danger of it happening so this book serves as a good warning.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

6939,451526341,3.0,"Frankly, Quite a Marginal Work",One person found this helpful,"If you stumble upon this review and have not yet purchased Animal Farm then let me proffer this advice: Buy George Orwell's 1984 instead if you hanker for a good poli-sci-fi read. If you already own 1984 or have read it then skip Animal Farm or find a copy to borrow (it can be read in its entirety in a leisurely afternoon). I realize this book is considered a classic--as well it should be. But it is a classic because of what it mocked, IMHO, and not because of what it represents as a literary work. The story is...incomplete and accelerates through large swaths of time--seemingly much more interested in arriving at a preordained conclusion than exploring the path along the way.Animal Farm was an idea George Orwell had for a tale of animals gaining the human capacity for self-awareness and self-actuation bent, prodded, and cajoled into a didactic telling of the evils of the Soviet Revolution. When one considers the pitched battle waged for the minds of the proletariat between West and East in the 1940's, 50's and 60's, it is easy to understand how this book could have garnered critical acclaim among Western intelligentsia. But as a bedtime story for children its diction is complicated and its message garbled for a developing mind; and as an allegory for adults it is ""childishly"" transparent in parts and rushed in others--so much so that I found it necessary to remind myself that I was reading a ""classic"" instead of being entranced by a great work.I would suggest one of two things happened in the telling of Animal Farm:One, Animal Farm was George Orwell's attempt to engender in youth a fear of Communism. If this was his intent I feel comfortable in my opinion that Animal Farm is an abject failure. I adore George Orwell's writing and his powerful prose, but he is no J.R.R. Tolkien meets Henry Kissinger.Two, Animal Farm was the stirrings of the Party, doublethink, and the idea of the perpetual struggle for no more than the struggle's sake. If this be the case, than Animal Farm was a fine effort that led to George Orwell's Magnum opus--1984. In either case, I do not think Animal Farm stands the test of time. That is, one hundred years from now I think this book is seen as nothing more than a quaint period piece.

January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.They’re polar opposites.In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they’re living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer’s block.Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She’ll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he’ll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in love. Really.Release Date May 19, 2020Initial ThoughtsI’m on a real contemporary kick these days. I’ve been alternating between fantasy and contemporary but I feel like after every contemporary book, I just want to read another. This is my third one this week. Also, my secret dream is to become a writer so a book about writers felt so right.Some Things I LikedEnemies to lovers. My favorite trope. I just loved it here. The tension between Gus and January was fantastic and they just had the best banter.Speaking of banter, I really enjoyed the dialogue and references used by both main characters. I’d expect nothing less from authors as characters, but I really enjoyed it.“Happy for now.” I actually really liked this sentiment. Happily ever afters are great – they’re basically why I like to read. But, happy for now, is something that I think people take for granted too often. I loved that this book focused on the present and the characters didn’t let worries for the future bog them down.“The wo-orst”. Not sure if this was Emily Henry’s intention, but in my head, I heard that line as Jean-Ralphio from Parks and Rec and I laughed out loud.27 Dresses vibes. I am not a big fan of Katherine Heigel, but I did like that movie. As soon as I read cynical Gus meets the queen of Happily Ever Afters, January, I knew that was where this book was going and I was all about that.Series ValueThis book feels like a true standalone. As much as I’d like to hear more about January and Gus, I feel like their story reached a nice conclusion. I’m very pleased with it and we really didn’t meet any other characters that would be worthy of a spin-off in my opinion.Final ThoughtsI really enjoyed this book. Both main characters grew and learned so much on their way to finding happiness and I loved their story. This book had everything I wanted in a good rom-com.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Recommendations for Further ReadingWell Met by Jen DeLuca – if you like enemies to lovers and down-to-earth quirky characters, try this series by Jen DeLuca.

So, I'm sad to give this one only 2 stars. While the story is pretty good (however I don't buy that Macy and Elliott wouldn't have known something about each other in the 11 years since they last spoke since there is  a wonderful little thing called the INTERNET), the real reason I'm giving this only 2 stars is because I listened to the Audible version. The Narrator is AWFUL! She is ridiculously breathy, and I didn't know it was possible to be both monotone and breathy at the same time, but apparently it is! She sounds as if she is trying to be sexy, but it's just annoying, and it NEVER stops. It's just her voice.

Interestingly, this vision is still valid today for most political movements. Orwell seeks to describe a very dark form of political control, which in essence is what all political parties try to do.

My heart soared at the prospect of continuing on the story of our beloved characters created by J.K., it was very pleasant to be immersed back into the wizardry world. However that being said I highly doubt that I will ever pick this up again, unlike the other 7 books that I have read time and time again. Many questions that we were all dying to know were in fact answered, but unfortunately I found myself reading just to find out what happens rather than being utterly bewitched by an unfolding plot. At several moments I found myself questioning the actions of the characters that didn't seem to ring true to the dispositions that was so clearly and thoughtfully painted in the original series. Yes I understand that 19 years has passed and time and starting families will change an individual but they seemed to be acting out of character. The plot itself wasn't even half of the quality that I've seen displayed, to be frankly honest if felt as if I was reading mediocre fanfiction. While I loved revisiting familiar places and faces it was a disappointment. By all means I believe potential readers should purchase it and for out for themselves.

He's like a teen who has just caught the philospher bug for the first time. And naturally the point-of-view often starts out self-centered. Seems like MM caught early insane luck and then decided that he had all the answers. After all, he was a big winner so his approach must be very wise and true. Only, the problem is that he stopped searching and questioning because he'd already won in his mind. That's why it comes off so immature. He was satisfied with himself before he should have been. He hasn't contemplated enough to claim to have the answers. But here are are. He does claim that. And proceeds with a lotta ""look what an awesome-winner"" I am stories. I'm only 2 years younger than MM and I tried to tell myself to keep an open mind. With the right life and attitude a person who is 50ish can know a lot. But this book got tiring. I had to keep getting disappointed and the resetting expectations. Over and over again. His level of luck must be about one in a quarter-billion. Top 1% experience.

6169,133821666X,2.0,Giant plot holes,5,"So this was enjoyable to read. But it was enjoyable as vaguely interesting fanfic rather than a legitimate part of the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed the characters but they weren't very complex and they were rather flat. Honestly my biggest issue with the play was the plot. So prepare yourself for SPOILERS!!! None of the plot makes sense because it involves using a Time Turner to travel back in time and change the past- which is not how time travel works in Harry Potter. It is very well established that when you go back in time using a Time Turner you do not change the time line- in fact the fact that you went back in time has always been part of the time line. Much like time travel in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. This is fairly crucial to the plot of Book 3 because Harry knows he can produce a patronus and get rid of the dementors because he has already experienced this the first time. If time travel worked the way it does in this play Harry would have been kissed by the dementors and never had the opportunity to go back in time and do anything- it would have been the end of the series. Furthermore, it would defeat the purpose of Hermione having the time turner in the first place because she would have created an alternate reality every time she went back in time and chose to go to a different class. It would have been unimaginable chaos.

In this case, the nasty human tendency to elevate self above others is portrayed through the lives of barnyard pals after they awaken to their disadvantaged status vis-a-vis the farmer. Spoiler alert: the pigs ultimately co-opt the trust (and hard work) of their fellow barnyard pals in order to ""elevate"" themselves to a life of mean-spirited debauchery. But it's the description of how they get there that makes this an important, revelatory work. The role of small lies, the other animals' various tendencies that actively or passively enfranchise the pigs, and time itself churn out more misery than the farmer himself could ever have doled out, even as the eventual arbiter of their demise. The work shows us a host of all-too-familiar ""tactics,"" and how, under certain circumstances, they can form a totalizing narrative that no one can see their way out of.

It’s amazing for me how he is able to describe sad things, violent events and all kind of abuses from such a high “vantage point”. What I mean is that he is able to tell the story of what happened and, at the same time, to find a silver lining in all of it, no matter how dark it seems to be. He is not in denial of the truth of each and every situation. On the contrary, he chooses to have a wider, higher and more refined perception, no matter of what he is writing about.And the fact that Trevor Noah succeeded in his life and his career in spite of all the hardship, with his soul and heart capable of love and affection toward his mother, siblings, friends and country, with such a humor, gives me a lot of hope and optimism for the future – my future, my son’s future, the future of all of us.I have never thought of visiting South Africa, but now I am quite curious: it seems that this country is populated with diamonds, some lighter, some darker, but diamonds nevertheless (and I am not talking about the mineral).Thank you for being alive, Trevor Noah!

First of all, being a die hard Harry Potter fan, having reading the books a dozen times in the last decade or so, having bought all of the extra books and holding J.K. Rowling to such a high standard I was extremely disappointed that her name was associated with this. It makes me feel a little better to know that she didn't actually write it, she just helped (?) come up with the general plot. It is frustrating, though, that she apparently did not even proof read?? There are so many things - big and small - that do not add up with the other books at all. The characters are barely even passable as themselves and even the terms are misspoken. ""Minister for Magic""??? It's been Minister of Magic for seven books and now it changes? Even just small things like that irk me so much because it really is as though this is a poor fan fiction that Rowling felt some need to attach her name to? The narration - although I understand the need to be in play/production format - doesn't sound remotely like her! So disappointed.

26588,133821666X,2.0,More Harry Potter is not Necessarily Better,35,"It was ok. I realized going into this that it was a stage script, and would therefore be missing many of the things that made the books so wonderful, as well as the somewhat constricting sense of space that plays tend to have. What I did not expect was such a poorly thought out plot. Spoilers ahead. I really thought this was going to be a story about the next generation, and while there were some new characters, this was a rehash of old ground...literally. It is all about time travel. I am not a huge fan of the time travel conundrum. It has been done many times, and certainly better than this foray into it. Introducing this element to the Harry Potter franchise in general is very problematic. I realize there was some of this in the stories already, but not to the extent that this one goes to. One of the other issues is that the whole adventure is such an unbelievable premise (bringing back Cedric Diggory) and out of character for these newly established characters that it is commented on by the other characters in the play. Sloppy writing. One of the worst examples of the sloppily written plot is the alternate universe where Snape is still around. First, there is no explanation as to why he survived, when the wand problem would have still existed (why he died to begin with), nor is there explanation as to why Voldemort et. al. still trust him and why he is palling around with Ron and Hermione, when they still would not know why he killed Dumbledore. I'm sure there could be some explanation, but none is given. It seemed like it was just an excuse to bring the character back. I loved Snape as much as the next person, but this did nothing to further his character and I would have rather they left him in his grave. All in all, I'm sure this is much better seen as a play, and they probably should not have released the script for that reason. I'm sure as you experience it, some of these things might be less important to just being in that world again and seeing it, but I can't imagine that the spectacle can entirely confund one from recognizing the bad writing beneath it.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

My box was already full with other new releases, so I opted to get it on Kindle instead after the book started to get good reviews in my BOTM circles!I did not have high expectations for this book after the first couple of chapters, I'll be honest. I was thinking it might be a solid 3 stars at best. However, I ended up REALLY liking it and it's a definite 4 star-read for me! (I save 5 stars for books that are just phenomenal-it's rare for me to think a book is worth all 5 coveted stars). In the beginning, the coincidences had me rolling my eyes. Come on, she just happens to land a beautiful free vacation home that is located right next door to a hunky fellow writer who ALSO just happens to be someone she went to school with and lusted over in college? One of those things, sure-but all of them? I also didn't love January's character in the beginning. But by the time she and Gus work out the details of their bet, I had started to like them both. By the end, I was 100% rooting for them both. The book seems to recognize and poke fun at its very own genre (women's fiction/rom-com), but it's smarter than a lot of books that I have read in this genre. The back-and-forth banter between January and Gus is fast, sarcastic, and witty. It's refreshing for both characters in the relationship to be smart and talented in their own right! And finally, what bumped the book up in my estimation is that at the end, there are some nice observations about what it means to choose to be in a long-term relationship and what 'happily ever after' really looks like.I do hope this book turns into a movie or mini-series because a screenplay will practically right itself. With the right casting, it would be great on-screen! There is a lot of tension between Gus and January for over half of the book and at the end, I could perfectly envision two different endings, either of which would have been in keeping with the story! That suspense over the ending (and my immense satisfaction with how she did choose to end the book) kept me hooked until the very end.Overall, I can enthusiastically give this book a recommendation. It is exactly what I like in a summer read and I would say it's worth the price for the Kindle version of the book! Yes, it's light and fluffy, but it's also smart and relatable. Definitely give it a try if you like this genre and want to know what all the buzz is about this summer!",True,romance,Language.ENGLISH

26928,133821666X,1.0,You'll be shocked JK Rowling approved this script,50,"As everyone here has already said, this book...err ""script"" wasn't written by JK Rowling. It's sad that's she has allowed her name to be plastered on the front of this book, because the writing style doesn't even come close to her own. It makes me wonder if she'd read the script, or only saw the production. The best was to summarize this explanation, is to compare it to ""Wicked"". We're all familiar with The Wizard of Oz, but no one ever thought what had happened there before Dorothy arrived. That's why the 'book' (not script) was popular (pun intended), & eventually written as a screenplay. This script is being touted as ""Book 8"". Sadly, that's not what it is at all. JK ruined the characters by allowing someone else to ""puppeteer"" her characters which she slowly allowed to grow and thrive. It's proof that a ""Book 9"" won't be written, because she'll have to clean up what was essentially a ghost writer did to her characters. The only way she'd be able to revive HP, would be to write a prequel. And that d need to be a direct prequel to The Harry Potter series. NOT Fantastic Beasts, which only links to Potter's world because he reads the book at Hogwarts. Book 8 has essentially ended Harry Potter for good.

However, if Fahrenheit 451 is read for entertainment value, it’s disappointing. The plot is slow, depressing, and sometimes unlikely. There is very little action in this book except for right at the end, and I find Montag to be a particularly bland character, and Clarisse is an implausible one. Fahrenheit 451 is not a book that is meant to be read for its interesting and likable characters, action packed plot, or satisfying ending. Fahrenheit 451 is meant to be read for its rich language, imagery, and themes. It is so skillfully written I could spend years reading it and still not fully appreciate everything it can convey through its imagery symbolism, and other literary devices.  I strongly recommend buying this book, and give it a five out of five.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

For most, this book has little to offer. Consider that even the title of the book uses language inaccurately. (The title indicates the approach offered is ""subtle"" - this is by no means the case. Much of the advice suggests radical changes that would be very obvious to others around you).

I am an English major but somehow this book had never made it's way in to my hands in either my High School or College careers. However after finishing this book I can see why this is a classic. The one thing I can't get my head around is why this book itself is the subject of being banned in school districts so often.When I first began reading Fahrenheit 451 it was a difficult read. The language and descriptions seem so foreign and alienating. Early in the book there is a scene where a character has their stomach pumped by a couple technicians. The description of this scene is so surreal. Bradbury uses these analogies to natural things to describe something so unnatural. I know that I am being vague in my own description of this scene but it is in the hopes to avoid any spoilers.The subject matter of this book rings very true today. Technology has short circuited basic human social behaviors to the point where everyone seems like a total unfeeling robot.

Well my dears, put away your knives and forks. There is no steak here. There is, however, plenty of sizzle, or whatever you might like to call the overabundance of hot air surrounding this sad little tome. Like many others who've reviewed this work, I too fell for the hype. The ""Instant #1 New York Times Bestseller!"" and ""Instant...Hollywood-bound...new thriller!""

(4) the author's knowledge (I use the term loosely) of psychiatry and psychiatric illness is pitiful. The caveat that ""borderlines are seductive"" is repeated ad nauseam, yet I don't recall Alicia ever being diagnosed with such - never mind that most mental health professionals nowadays hesitate to affix the 'borderline' label because of its enormous stigma. (5) the 'celebrity' endorsements - how the frilly heck did that happen? I mean, please, tell me. Because for the life of me I can't figure it out. This is just a really, really, really bad book.

26670,133821666X,1.0,An enormous disappointment for Potter fans and misleading to those who are new to the world,9,"I'm not sure what happened here. The only thing I can guarantee is that JK Rowling had nothing to do with the crafting of this story. Reading a play is an inherently different experience from reading a novel, of course. Novels like the Potter series are full of rich narration and world building, whereas a play is reliant almost solely on the quality of the dialogue. Nuances in character development and narrative must come to life in the dialogue, even when watching a stage production, because true theater doesn't rely on sets, scenery or special effects. Reading the play should be comprable to seeing it live: of course, quality actors bring it to life, but seeing King Lear in person isn't generally any more powerful than reading the incredible script in your living room. Was I naive for hoping for this kind of quality? Probably not, considering the playwrights are so accomplished. The dialogue in Rowling's books was, admittedly, not the most compelling, but her narrative and world building made up for it. Absent that, and absent a writer with a gift of crafting character interactions, this book was a massive disaster. It truly does read like bad fanfiction, with massive leaps of logic and plot holes that are impossible to swallow and one-dimensional, cookie-cutter characters (something I think the Potter books avoided foxily). As a lifelong Potter fan, I can't really accept this as canon, and I hope that those new to the Potter universe will avoid this chapter in the saga entirely.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

Do you think there is any possible way an 8th story would have met expectations, even if it was in a book format? You should listen to the warnings the original series gave us about bringing back the dead. Harry Potter is basically your childhood. The stakes were astronomically high. Wait, did Back to the Future and Twilight have a baby? I’m not sure. I got lost. Too many time turners, and I’m not buying that “Voldy” (how sensitive, after a generation of genocide) had a kid. How could J.K. Rowling write this? She didn’t. If you read it as fan fiction, you will be less disappointed. “It is a script, dummies. You aren’t experiencing the real story because you have to see it in person.” What percentage of the fan base can feasibly fly to London and secure a ticket? Why on earth are they selling the script for twenty-bucks a pop if it can’t stand alone? And I’m sorry, but a plot hole is a plot hole. Why revisit and muck up the great, iconic scenes (as much fun as it will be to re-read the Triwizard Tournament picturing two dorky boys lurking around)? Why not create an original story? Wait, did Ron just turn into Fred or George Weasley? Love potion gag gifts? Didn’t he almost die from one of those once upon a time? Come to think of it, are any of the characters themselves? I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Hermione so incompetent or Harry so blah. And I’m totally buying that a little humiliation from the ever-courageous Cedric turned him into a raging death eater. Serious question, why is Draco not in Azkaban? He was a known death eater. Why is Bellatrix rotting away while he is out and about with his secret time turner? Come on, wasn’t there anything positive? The nervous, I-might-throw-up emotional excitement I felt for a sustained five minutes before I could muster the courage to open the book was thrilling (it is not every day you think you get to read Harry Potter again for the first time). To be fair, I also had a hard time putting this script down. Humanizing Slytherin was a good move. Scorpius is a decent character. Meeting Snape again was nice. If this was published and recognized as fan fiction, I might give it a 3/5. I’m holding back my final judgments until I can see the work as intended, a full performance.

10810,1984806734,4.0,4.5 Fantastic Stars!!!,One person found this helpful,"I’ve seen people rate this book highly for months and seen the fantastic reviews of this wonderful romantic drama and so, I can add to those accolades and say that this really WAS amazing and I am absolutely blown away.This book straddles that line between romance and “women’s fiction” ( I know the latter is not our favourite description of the genre) where there is a strong romantic tone to the main plot, but also the book doesn’t follow traditional romance plot mapping and often feels like it’s more a book about the perceptions of romance as a genre and what it takes to write a book when you’re experiencing a writer’s block.The premise is that successful women’s fiction writer, January, is experiencing writer’s block after having had her belief in HEAs  ripper away by betrayal and tragic events in her life. She meets her longtime nemesis, Gus, an acclaimed literary fiction writer and the two, somewhat scornful of each other’s genres, challenge each other to write a book in the other person’s genre.This book is filled with page after page of devastatingly funny, laugh out loud humor. I mean that I literally cackled, belly-laughed, giggled, snorted, my way through this because the author’s humor is amazing and comes on strong on every page, but yet this isn’t a romantic comedy or an upbeat light-hearted book as you might imagine from the depth of the humor and pages of laughs it delivers. This is a book that you could say is a little sad, centered on themes of loss and grief, of feeling like you’ve lost yourself, of childhood trauma and how it impacts adult life and of love being victorious even though love doesn’t guarantee a romance novel HEA.Reading this, I learned a lot about the writing process and what it takes to be a novelist. It’s not that I ever thought it was easy street, but I’m even more in awe of the achievement of writers. If there’s any slight criticism of this, is that it rushed through the middle points a little bit once the characters got on the same page and it was a bit of an obvious glossing. Also, this isn’t the most exciting plot where dramatic things happen, it’s a sort of quiet and introspective book without a lot of external conflict or even really that much character conflict. The characters are going through things and that makes this interesting but it’s not especially exciting.That said, I HIGH KEY loved this book. I highlighted large swathes of it because everything was so beautifully written and aptly expressed. The last 25% especially took my heart with it because it was so beautifully expressed. The epilogue had my heart singing and crying happy tears as it articulated what really makes a HEA in real life and how it’s really a series of HFN moments. I can’t praise this book enough! I think EVERY romance fan, indeed every reader should check out this funny, poignant, absolutely delightful book.",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH

At first this annoyed me, but it is somewhat refreshing to see a play that will receive such widespread release. Hopefully this can help renew interest among readers for plays. CON - The writing is just not good. I question how much involvement Rowling actually had with this story. I definitely question her actually putting pen to paper on it. - The story is so disjointed. It skims by characters without any kind of introduction or background. This should have been expanded into two or three books to have made any sense. - The ending is awful.

I look forward to more books about how the next chapters in his life. The most valuable part about this book however was that I got insights into how people in poverty and discrimination learn to think and act to survive.  Trevor was born during apartheid when the races were strictly segregated by government policy.  Trevor is racially mixed and therefore a crime because his parents broke a taboo against interracial relationships. Because of his racial ambiguity, he was often seen as a potential threat to others.  Trevor was able to negotiate this sometimes treacherous territory when he encountered others because he could speak the languages of his neighbors and classmates.  Language neutralized initial suspicions  so he could interact and connect as a person and not a stranger from another race.

Guy Montag is a fire fighter who starts fires instead of putting them out. He enjoys and even loves his work until he meets Clarisse and from then he questions everything he has ever known.He lives a dull life with his wife, Mildred who spends her days with her television family and continually wants for more. He meets his young neighbour, Clarisse who has a zest for life and the small things therein. She constantly questions life and the law and everything in between, Guy is suddenly drawn to her and when she disappears without a trace, everything Guy has known begins to change. He not only questions his job but life in general. Reading and knowledge is something forbidden and frowned upon. Happiness is the main goal of the times but only to be achieved with television, and innocuous conversation. Guy begins hiding books and eventually his wife sends an alarm and he must answer the call to burn his own books. He runs away to avoid being arrested and ends up joining a group of like minded people who are waiting for the times to change by memorizing books.Bradbury has written close to 600 short stories, 30 books and numerous poems and essays.

I started with their Beautiful Bastard series and absolutely adored it, and quickly gobbled up the rest of the series.

When they came out with Autoboyography, I was straight onto it and really liked it. I felt it knocked their dynamic out of whack a little bit, just because it was so different to what they usually did - but without comparing it to their other works, it really was a fantastic book and something that is very necessary in young adult literature. So, honestly, I was a little sceptical when this one emerged... But I couldn't stop myself from buying it.

The timeline is inaccurate and the author basically cheats the reader by making you think the ending could possibly not have been that way because there’s like a 6 year gap in between what’s happening but he never explains this. Also, the therapeutic relationship between the main character, who’s the therapist, and Alicia is unethical and unprofessional to every degree.

I had high hopes for it, as the plot sounded promising: a psychotherapist becomes obsessed with trying to help a disturbed woman convicted of murdering her husband, who hasn't spoken a word since she was discovered standing over the husband's corpse. Unfortunately it turned out to be a big disappointment. It has one thing going for it: a really good plot twist near the end. It's a very clever idea, even if the explanation behind it is far-fetched, and was a complete surprise to me. If only the rest of the novel had been up to the same standard... The author has clearly done plenty of research on psychology and psychotherapy; there are frequent stodgy lumps of regurgitated theory throughout. The writing itself is poor and prone to clichés, the hurried pace allows for no detail or reflection and the characterisation is weak and unconvincing. It's set in London but the language and dialogue often feel like they were written by an American or at least someone who has spent much time in America (I'm not sure of the author's nationality). The symbolism used is painfully unsubtle and the attempts to create tension generally fall flat. There are also a number of plot holes and unexplained threads left dangling at the end.

However, I was interested in reading about his background and his take on growing up in South Africa.  It was well worth it.  Over time, I've reserved five stars for books that totally blow me away, but Noah's book deserves a solid four-star rating for its content and for its approach to the humor, irony and tragedy that constituted South Africa prior to the end of apartheid and, if he is to be believed (and I do believe him) even after the establishment of a government led by Nelson Mandela.Noah's observations are keen, and the importance of his family and, in particular, his mother, are often poignant and comical at the same time.

Love and Other Words is an adult contemporary romance that is equal parts coming of age, friends becoming lovers, loss and heartache, and second chance romance—all combined in one potent fictional cocktail. It is 100% amazing!You know you have a winner on your hands when you lose sight of the fact that you’re reading fiction because the story seems so real. The intricacies of the plot, as well as the complexity of the characters and their interactions with one another, make the story entirely absorbing and believable. I could not read the pages fast enough.The fact that Elliott and Macy are fellow bibliophiles makes them kindred spirits. However, I have no words to describe my level of adoration of them. I can say the tale of their meeting as awkward tweens, followed by their transition to best friends and then to high school loves, is just as fascinating as the mystery of their fall-out, decade-long separation, and subsequent reunion.Sporadic flashbacks in books can be a distraction if not handled with care. In this case, the timelines are purposeful and orderly; each chapter alternates between “now” and “then.” It creates a sense of honesty and perfect clarity to the depth of Macy and Elliott’s relationship. I can’t imagine the story unfolding any other way.The writing duo of Christina Lauren has truly outdone themselves with this tender and deeply moving romance. I don’t have to think twice about giving Love and Other Words five enthusiastic stars.",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH

8375,786965606,4.0,The current edition is a good compromise of old & new,One person found this helpful,"Let's preface this with the fact that I'm old(ish). I'm 40, and when I started gaming in my childhood it was with folks a good 15-20 years older than me. So I started with a blend of original D&D, 1st ed., and pre-'players option' 2nd. ed. (which was in print when I started). Call it nostalgia or being stuck in my fuddy duddy ways if you like, but I've always preferred those editions to anything that came after for a variety of feel pretty solid reasons. 3.0/3.5 had its merits, as a totally different sort of game (less creative rules improvisation by groups as there were rules for EVERYTHING, and a system seemingly intended/designed for extremely high powered play with a lot of rules lawyering). I enjoyed it on those merits, for a different style of play. We'll ignore the trainwreck that was 4th ed. here, as we should.Which brings me to 5th ed. While I still miss TSR, I think WotC did a really good job marrying some of hard rules for customization, the scalable difficulty/rewards, and improved book layouts from 3.0/3.5 with a little more of the simplicity and ease of play of 1st/2nd. I think they could have gone a little farther taking systems back to the earlier editions, but I also realize they are *VERY* focused on organized, sanctioned, and tournament play, the portability of characters/players between them, and the idea of 'seasons' (something maybe they're trying to export from MMORPGs to draw in a new audience?). I'm sure this is a holdover practice from MtG. That sort of focus of course removes the possibility of house rules and discussion/negotiation/agreement between players for purposes of plugging holes in or otherwise altering rules. I'm not crazy about that direction for the product line, which cost them a star here. But in terms of production quality, value for the cost, and a thankful return to some recognizable systems and an abandonment of 4th ed., I think they've done pretty good job here.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

12102,B01IW9TM5O,5.0,Glorious,35 people found this helpful,"This book is absolutely glorious. I’m so in love right now, I can barely function. This memoir is unquestionable one of the most engaging books I’ve ever read, filled with such greatly vivid and riveting anecdotes, made more profound and unforgettable by the fact that they’re true.I don’t watch The Daily Show, other than a few occasional clips on social media, and I never followed this guy before, so I decided to read this book solely because of the title. I love it. Born a Crime—it just feels meaningful. And, it is meaningful. I’m walking away from this experience knowing now that I love Trevor Noah. I love his writing and I love his wit. He is a fantastic storyteller who told of his childhood, one that was layered heavily with sadness, but for the majority of the time while reading his journey, I felt joyous.This memoir is a compilation of notable anecdotes, mixed in with short passages of African history for context against the very special circumstances of Trevor’s birth and childhood. Let me tell you, his childhood is better than any fiction and there are too many humorous and affecting moments to count. Some of my favorites include, the time when a criminal, young Trevor, who was being held prisoner in his Grandmother’s house (for his own good), crawled through a hole under a fence to get to freedom. Then, there’s the time when his first dog, Fufi, taught him his first lesson in love and betrayal. Or, the time when, after growing up on the kind of creative diet that only the very poor are weaned on, Trevor was left completely unimpressed with high cuisine meals such as bone marrow, which are no different or better than the dog bones he ate at home. For more funny and interesting stories, read this book!Born a Crime begins before his birth, when his impetuous and wise mother convinced her kind, white neighbor to give her a baby, during a time when there were strictly enforced laws that prohibited intercourse between Natives and Europeans. The stories he describe span from that time to the end of Apartheid, and further to a time when blacks and coloreds were free to live the life they could wrangle from the system.Trevor’s—I’m calling him Trevor because I feel like I know him now. His thoughts on race and power are spot on and made more impressive because of his ability to use humor to show the illogical and ridiculous nature of the whole enterprise. Trevor is very smart, and a very adept communicator. There isn’t a single part of this memoir that doesn’t pierce you, wound you with truths, yet it soothes you with humor. I laughed because it was impossible not to. I laughed so hard that I cried, and then I cried because I had to cry.Trevor grew up on a divided country, and the numerous poignant moments show clearly a boy caught between the many cultures of South Africa, which he navigated by becoming a chameleon, fitting in everywhere and nowhere at the same time. He adapted to each new situation as many entertainers do, by being whoever the people want them to be. That’s not to say that Trevor is disingenuous in any way; no, he’s observant, and his musings on life and relationships make it apparent that he has a damn good understanding of the human condition.What is most lovely about his coming-of-age story is how Trevor speaks about his mother. His mom features largely in his story, and his love and respect for her is obvious, not only in his words, but in the actions he describes. Their bond is a tangible thing, and the most moving pockets of this book are the ones filled with his mom.Honestly, this memoir is so brilliantly insightful that there are many many pages I marked, so many gems and memories I’ve saved to revisit again and again. I don’t read a lot of biographies, preferring fiction to real life, but I’m insanely delighted that I strayed from my norm and read Born a Crime. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, sincerely, because it is truly glorious.Audiobook notes: Just perfect. Trevor Noah pulls you in with his animated voice and more than brings this story to life.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

12544,786965606,5.0,Best I've played since 2nd Edition,,"Terrific.  This is 5th Edition D&D, although they don't seem to be marketing that term ""5th Edition"" much at all.  Rest assured that this is it.  If you've played D&D, I'll just sum this up by saying that it definitely takes a turn back towards the old school style of role-playing.  The focus in how you play your character, not how you optimize his stats.  If you played 4th Edition, you know that it almost seems like a consolidation of D&D Miniatures and an MMO.  Well, not this.  This is about immersion in an imaginary world and escapism.  This is about creating truly memorable stories and people that you want to learn about.  It's exploration, lore, intrigue, mystery, peril, fantasy, and more.  If you're playing with a combat-centered group, 4th or 3.5 is probably more optimized for that.  5th is taking us back to that nerd heaven time period where we consumed Cheetos and Mountain Dew in our friend's mom's basement while talking in different voices and doing our best to stop laughing long enough to do something productive before the end of the night.

Whether you're a new player or DM, you'll want this book. It's necessary in my opinion, and I would recommend the physical book over a digital copy. Digital is convenient for your phone but the book is easier to read and flip through when playing and in between sessions. The book itself is actually higher quality than I expected (and I had high expectations); it feels solid and it's easy to move through quickly but is worth the time to admire the art and all the hard work it took to make it look so nice. As far as the edition itself goes, I think it's perfect for those new to D&D. However, I feel that it tries too hard to make every single ability, class, race, and option perfectly balanced with every other one. And so the characters themselves wind up pretty generic. I came from 3.5e, the edition for unique characters and it was the opposite of balanced. If you have a hard time with powerful characters or feel it's unfair if some characters are better at some things than others, 5e is perfect for you. I miss the options in 3.5e but then again, I had to buy way more books to have them. Some of the changes seem arbitrary, some are truly mystifying but, in the end, it's D&D: homebrew it. Fun over rules. That being said, you do not need this book immediately for your first session but, if you tried the game and want to keep playing for a good long time, buy this book...right after you get some dice.

It took three days to read it and about 3 mins to toss it into the trash can. What a collection of overindulgent, egotistical blathering! Using the suffering of physical and mental abuse transformed into pleadings for parental approval, MM goes off on tangents about how the only way to be a 'man' is to suffer the beatings by his father, and the emotional torture of a totally immature mother. He talks about this journeys in a world of reality and relativity bringing him insight and knowledge as a way of proving to himself that he's worth something, working in an industry that does nothing but create fantasies and make believe. He runs off to far away locations in search of who he is, financed by a society that buys into celebrity worship and then spits it all back to the reader in poorly written, horribly crafted philosophies. If he wasn't an actor, a car salesman, and a whiskey hawker would we care? I think not. SKIP THIS BOOK.",False,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

I would give zero stars if I could. These are not the characters that I know and love. The author was not able to capture any of Rowlings' magic in any aspect.

26529,133821666X,2.0,Be advised: J.K. Rowling did not write this play,1,"I (like most of the people who read this play) grew up loving the Harry Potter series. I must have reread all seven books a dozen times at least... which is why I could tell right away that J.K. Rowling did not write this. Since her name came first on the credits, I assumed that she had creative control over this project, but I did some research once I had finished and found that this was not the case. She gave the other authors pointers here and there, and perhaps gave them some insight into the characters that only she, their creator, could have, but other than that she had little to nothing to do with this play. I wish I had known that before I bought the book, so I will say it clearly to you right now: if you are looking for a follow-up to the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling herself, this book is not for you. The story isn't bad and it has some really clever twists, but it reads like a bland fanfiction story (which, in a way, I guess it is). The characters don't have the same ""voice"" as they did in the original series, and it is jarring to read. It is someone else's interpretation of what our beloved characters should sound like, and this made it feel fake to me. The characters also don't speak in a way that sounds natural in general, even aside from them not sounding like themselves. Another thing I didn't like was that everything in the text was clearly designed to manipulate readers based on their sense of nostalgia. Events from prior books were brought up just for the sake of saying ""hey, remember that thing that happened in that other book you loved? I remember too."" This took time out of the real story and led to too quick of a wrap-up at the end of what could have been a hugely monumental reveal/crisis in the wizarding world, as well as to a complete dismissal of several new characters who were introduced in the beginning of the play. Basically, this play takes bits and pieces from all of the real Harry Poter books and uses them to try to tell a new story that falls flat. Of course we all want to know what happened to our favorite characters after the Harry Potter series ended, but that is the beauty of reading a really good book: the author brings you to the end of her story, and then you get to decide in your mind how everything turned out beyond that. It is understandable, though, that people jump at the chance to read a follow-up supposedly written by the woman who started it all - but I think now that it might have just been better to let the original seven books end where they ended, and leave the rest to your own imagination. The thing that bothered me most about this play is not that it is a bad story in and of itself, it is that it was falsely advertised. Sometimes it is fun to read Harry Potter fanfictions online, but you always know that those are not written by J.K. Rowling herself. This book has her name on it, but she was hardly involved with its creation at all. This felt like a betrayal of her readers, and I feel cheated on both a financial level (even as an ebook this book was not cheap!) and on a personal level. I feel like a great friend from my childhood just lied to me to make more money for herself.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

That's what this book feels like. As if the author knew what pieces made up a romance novel, but, having never seen or read one before, she was flummoxed as to how to put these pieces together. She wrote the kissing scenes and there are people saying ""I love you,"" but beyond that, this doesn't feel like a romance. It's just a poorly written book with a bunch of sex and forced banter.Full disclosure: I read The Wedding Date last year and didn't love it. However, that was the author's first book, and I wanted to give her a fair chance before I wrote off her other work. I wanted to see if — after completing the writing, publishing and reviewing process — she had grown as a writer.It seems that she has not.1. The writing. The writing is bad, both at the micro level and the macro level.

This is something an editor should have caught and it pisses me off that it made it to the final page. Also, the characters are constantly making ""witty"" observations that are, in reality, ridiculous or nonsensical. Such as this:""Oh God. [The fitness instructor] was the kind of person who said “all of your beautiful faces.” What had [Nik] gotten them into? She saw Courtney and Dana exchanging glances.""I don't know what's wrong with people who use the phrase ""all your beautiful faces"" and the characters never tell us. So instead of coming off as insightful or clever, they just sound shallow and judgmental. Also, the writing frequently gaslights the reader. Characters often refer to events that never happened or happened completely different than how they describe them. Finally, there are many instances with inconsistent style, names, etc. No one gave this a thorough edit and it's VERY obvious.2. The characters. I don't have much to say about there characters because there's not much there. The characters are bland cardboard cut-outs with no real personalities. If you were to ask me to describe any of them, beyond their occupations or what they look like, I'd have nothing to tell you.Nik and Carlos are also surprisingly unsympathetic. I didn't love Alexa or Drew from the last one (I also barely remember them because they, too, are nothing but flat stick figures pretending to be people), but I didn't actively dislike them. Nik and Carlos go on constantly about how they don't want to be bothered with the other's personal life. Carlos actively antagonizes one of Nik's friend while helping out with a stressful work emergency. He also shares embarrassing stories about his teenage patients with Nik, which I assume is in direct violation with HIPAA. Nik admits to mocking her boyfriend's friends to their face. They're both jerks and I don't think either of them deserve a happy ending.3. The plot. THERE IS NO PLOT! This book has no structure and it's frustrating as hell to read. It's just a collection of boring pointless scenes that go nowhere!The book gets it's title from the opening meet-cute. Nik is proposed to by her boyfriend, Carlos witnesses it and whisks her away, but then ... nothing. Nothing of any consequence happens. They go out to eat, they have sex, they agonize over basic social interactions that normal adults would figure out in .02 seconds, they repeat. This is exactly what happened in The Wedding Date and it drove me insane.The baseball proposal cannot make up the entirety of the story, and a romance should have action beyond the two leads making kissy faces at each other. What if, after the proposal, Nik and Carlos agree to enter a fake relationship to help recover their reputations? Nik is freelance writer and probably brands herself on social media. The fake relationship could turn into a real one and that would provide the conflict for the story.LITERALLY ANYTHING happening would have been better than what we got.The missing structure also accounts for all the repetition in the story. We read as these characters go out to eat four or five times. Angela bugs her brother about seeing a doctor four of five times. The question ""How's Jessie doing?"" is asked FIVE times with no apparent progress or impact to the story. (Jessie is one of Carlos' sisters and her only defining feature is that she has preeclampsia. What fun.)And 4. the ""romance."" LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL what romance? This story is as romantic as the Federal tax code. They meet when Carlos, for reasons we're not told about, decides he has to save Nik from her embarrassing spectacle at the stadium. They text back and forth for a bit afteward, have dinner, comment about how ~*~*~*~*HAWT*~*~*~*~ the other is and then, VERY suddenly, decide they want to jump each other's bones. There's no lead up to it. There's no sense of attraction or chemistry. It honestly feels like that ""Now kiss!"" meme; someone just shoving two characters faces together because they want to see the sexy times.These two have no real emotional ties to the other. Nik doesn't even want to be bothered with meeting Carlos' best friend. The bad writing plus their non-existent characterization means I have no investment in this ""romance.""I could go on and on, but I've wasted enough time on this book.

26547,133821666X,2.0,The Curse of the fan fiction,7,"SPOILER FREE With 9 years, millions of works of fan fiction, a world of fan theories and wild shippings, since The Deathly Hallows, The Cursed Child is stepping into dangerous waters to call itself canon. So does it float? First, I really wish I could see the play – there’s so much in how a good actor can bring something to life that the page can’t capture, unless the playwright has the sparkling wit of Oscar Wilde. And unfortunately, Thorne doesn’t. While a few characters do shine on the page, many feel off. As a “canon” sequel, this play could have taken the Harry Potter story, for better or worse, in some new direction. Instead, it chooses to play it safe and function as a curtain call of old favorites rather than exploring new ground. That’s both a positive and a negative. The story as a story suffers for it, but those same choices also serve to insulate the Harry Potter the world grew up with from any changes or damage a sequel could do. So while it doesn’t add anything new or wonderful to the story, it also doesn’t really detract from the original either. It just is. But is it worthwhile? The best parts of the story are with the characters who are wholly new to the story – or at least one in particular. He’s a bright point of dry humor and a bucket of cold water on the obligatory-angst-filled pity parties many of the other characters indulge in. And then there are the cameos. And depending on who your favorite witches or wizards were, you may more or less enjoy them. One had me as excited as possible, and it was handled really, really well. (That means me literally dancing around my kitchen with my Kindle.) There are the inside jokes – though there could have been more – and the intentional? unintentional? references to famous works of fan fiction. There were the obligatory deus ex machina moments, some heavy handed character growth dialogue (what can you do with the short space of a play?) There were also some meaningful conversations about growing up. All the same, I wish they would have marketed it as a “one off” rather than a “eighth story.” I know, I know, people wouldn’t have bought it otherwise, but still. It made the moments of incongruity more jarring and annoying than they would have been otherwise. Because, with or without JKR’s input, yes, there are moments in the play where real, important details from the books are either glossed over, shrugged at or ignored. Not little side things. Things that are key to the play’s conclusion and are a big deal in the books. The kind of things that render this play *not* canon, no matter what they say. So my conclusion? It was fun. I’m glad I read it. But if you please, I’ll be the judge of what I care to consider “real” and those things I’ll shrug off as fan fiction. Because, quite honestly, that’s mostly what this is. I’ll take Scorpius though. Scorpius makes this worth reading. I’ll very gladly add his character to canon. ******A final note: *don’t* read the HP books before reading this. Start with this, and let this play launch you back into the much superior world of the books. This would be a lame note to end on after all that. In fact, I think that’s what I’m going to go read next……",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

27977,125030170X,2.0,Disappointing after all the hype,,"Sadly, this did not live up to the hype. The Silent Patient was one of the big bestsellers of 2019, and I was starting to feel like the only thriller reader left in the world not to have read it. I bought it on special ages ago and have been meaning to find out what all the fuss was about ever since. I won’t say I regret finishing it - I needed to know what The Big Twist was, it was a fast easy read on a cold grey day with nowhere else I needed to be, but I got to the end feeling let down and dissatisfied. With 94 994 reviews already on GoodReads, I don’t need to summarise the plot. There are over a million star ratings, the majority 4 and 5 stars, so clearly lots of people loved this. I guessed the twist about half way through and kept hoping I’d be wrong. Looking at a sample of the negative reviews, they are mostly from people with experience of working in mental health. I had concluded that the author must know nothing about modern psychiatry, so was gobsmacked to discover that he trained as a psychotherapist and spent two years working in a secure unit. To me the whole idea that a specialist unit on the verge of being shut down would employ a non-medically qualified psychotherapist who then proceeds to float about only treating one patient - that he clearly has an unhealthy obsession with - was ludicrous. None of the staff seem to notice that he’s constantly disappearing off to play detective and doesn’t actually do any work. The casual way the staff treat (using both the loosest and medical senses of that word) the patients was actually disgusting. I can see that a lay person could disregard all of this, and enjoy it as a compulsive suspense story, especially if you read it without being constantly on the lookout for The Twist, and don’t mind a hefty dose of writerly sneakiness. I’m not a literary snob and thought the writing was fine, but was bothered by the protagonist’s misogyny - only beautiful or maternal type women are worthy of his interest - and he really doesn’t like overweight people. The central mystery - why won’t Alicia speak? -wasn’t satisfactorily explained and lots of other threads were left hanging. I see that the author is a screenwriter and that this has been optioned as a movie - I actually think I would’ve enjoyed this more without Theo’s distasteful internal monologue and in the right hands this could make a great film. 2.5 rounded down for complete implausibility.",False,children,Language.ENGLISH

Devices used by characters in books, like a ""shell radio"" or ""TV wall"" (which is even interactive) are very similar to devices we have now. Moreover, behavior of the people in the book is very close to actual ones as well (it means that there is only one approach to life and everybody who does not follow it is considered to be bad and to be against the system). From my point of view, the book is warning of slavery which technology (in governments hands) could bring to us if we accepted and used it mindlessly, irresponsibly and without questioning. It is warning of what government would do with technology in order to stalk people and control them. However, Bradbury's book is not so pesimistic as e.g. Orwell's ones, since it ends with hope for change in the future.I would recomend the book to everybody who likes good sci-fi and moreover, who has her or his mind open to thinking about future with accepting that it could not be so nice as goverments and authorities trying to persuade us.Have a nice reading! :-)",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

Also, let’s be more original with names, Liza/Lina/Tina, and don’t even get me started on Waylon/Waylan. WHY would you do that to your readers? And then give 16 nicknames to the coffee-guzzling main character who says “ignoramus” and gets applauded for her amazing vocabulary?

12602,786965606,5.0,The best edition of D&D to date; a must-have.,2 people found this helpful,"The first thing tat impressed me was how ""clean"" it is. No more number-crunching; skills, damage, and other statistics are handled with elegance and simplicity that nevertheless does not deprive the gameplay of complexity or limit you in any way. Advantage and disadvantage mechanics make a comeback from 4th edition as a solution for realizing conditions and circumstances in combat and outside of it, affecting all situations that ask for a d20 ""probability"" die roll, which is better than applying various numeric penalties that are a pain to keep track of. Other than that, it feels closer to 3rd edition than to controversial 4th.Races are pretty much the same old (humans, elves, dwarves, halflings), plus gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, tieflings, and dragonborn. Racial abilities seem quite balanced ATM. Classes are all basic classes you could find in D&D 3.5, with warlock finally gaining a solid ""personality"" and niche of his own, and prestige classes becoming archetypes - specializations within classes that you get to choose upon 1st-3rd level depending on class, varying between two and as much as eight options per class. It's worthy of noting that Eldritch Knight and Arcane Trickster are fighter and rogue archetypes that allow limited spellcasting without having to multiclass (which is also an option).The absolutely best part is the new backgrounds. Not just mere empty blocks in which you're supposed to write down your character's story (which not everyone even cares about), backgrounds offer you a choice of niche within society, a set of personal traits, ideals, bonds and flaws that help you define your character and establish a personality, providing a solid outline for RPing, like the basis for alignment (classic nine alignments) and the reason for your character to be involved (bonds). Inspiration mechanic is now a core rule - at DM's discretion, players can be rewarded for being true to their character's story with and ""inspiration point"" (which do not accumulate in any way), which can be used to reroll any d20 (attack, check, or saving throw) once a day.As for the quality of the printing itself, it's on an expectably high level.All in all, this is an undisputable must-have for all fans of pen-and-paper RPGs that easily beats all previous editions and Pathfinder.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

Daywalt introduces us to Duncan's box of crayons; a box that has had enough. The crayons are going on strike, and tell Duncan - through a series of hilariously honest letters - all the reasons why they can't work for him anymore. The idea of crayons going on strike is funny to begin with, but Daywalt manages to combine that humor with intelligence and charm, as the book looks into all the reasons why the crayons feel the way that they do. As we learn that the red crayon feels overworked, or that the white crayon feels underused, the book helps reinforce the idea of respecting one another, and also respecting the idea of sharing and of being equal in our day-to-day lives. Within all of those letters, there's also a positive lesson of the value of speaking your mind. Duncan manages to find a solution for the crayons that brings harmony and joy back into the crayon box, and back into Duncan's life. With delightful artwork from Oliver Jeffers - seriously, the way the letters were written + accompanying drawings made me crack up - this is a book has become a instant winner in my book. *** Bottom line: This is a book with not only a unique premise, but smart lessons, funny writing and charming drawings, which makes this a must-have for every shelf. I predict that Daywalt and Jeffers will cause generations of kids to look at their crayon boxes a little differently after reading this, and will have them wondering just what it is their crayons are thinking.",False,children,Language.ENGLISH

10803,1984806734,4.0,Pull it out of the beach bag,,"Do not judge this book by its cover.  Beach Read is much more than it’s cute cover and sweet blurb. It has depth and emotion that I wasn’t expecting. What happens when the writer who is all about the HEAs stops believing in them?  January Andrews is exactly that writer. She’s struggling with everything life has dealt her and in comes Augustus “Gus” Everett. He is her seemingly complete opposite, a former college rival and writer.  On a bet their story begins. Told solely from January’s perspective, life, love and all its complexities are told in an fluid pace. I never felt like I was missing out, getting what I needed of Gus from their interactions and conversations.January Andrews is funny and relatable, she had worries, insecurities, and was questioning everything about her life, family and history. She’s been thrown for a loop. I hurt right along with her. Yet her optimism was infectious even when she questioned it.Augustus “Gus” Everett may have been a brooding and grumpy hero, but he wasn’t a jerk. The walls he has built are completely understandable. He was a bit pessimistic due to circumstances. He held back yet he was also so sweet and kind.As their “dates” began, the challenge to spend their time wisely is both fun and eye opening.  Their conversations told a lot. They shared a fantastic connection and such great chemistry. Beach Read was more than that book you drag down to the water.

To be clear, I have no issue with unlikeable protagonists, and I love dark humor and satire, but there's nothing remotely interesting about this book. Our gorgeous 20something narrator works in a Manhattan art gallery and decides to process grief over her parents' death by taking a year off in a haze of prescription meds and booze. And since the book kicks off in late 2000, it's pretty clear the story of her year will climax with 9/11. And so the reader spends endless pages watching her attempt to sleep through the year. She's flush with money, but seems to have almost no human connections -- there's one friend, whom she finds incredibly annoying and does her best to push away. She has a finance-bro jerk ex-boyfriend she makes booty calls to. There's a space-cadet shrink who gives her whatever prescriptions she wants. And there are the Egyptian guys in the bodega by her building, and that's about it. I guess one might see it all as some kind of raw, unflinching portrait of depression, but it's certainly not an interesting one. It's hard not to read it as a ""poor little rich (and gorgeous) girl"" woe-is-me story, and then 9/11 comes along to knock her out of it? It's actually kind of offensive.

That being said I did read it and I am amazed that women in 2022 would think it good. The 'hero' is an abusive, domineering, foul mouthed jerk. Is this what women want? He engages in a pull - push 'romance' with the heroine who is too soft to survive. She does toughen up slightly over time but then lets herself down by giving into the 'hero' thinking she is in love. Throughout the story he grabs her, drags her, pushes her - seriously is this woman not allowed to move of her own volition? He doesn't know what he wants and uses and gaslights the 'heroine'. He is not sure he wants her but he gets angry whenever any other man wants her. He is also very fond of the F word. Now to my mind there is a use for the word such as when you drop a brick on your foot, the dog runs away, your fiance is found in flagrante with the bridesmaid or the children set fire to the house. Even the liberal use of the F word seems acceptable to me in those sort of circumstances.

27512,125030170X,2.0,Assault by cliches,185.0,"I'm pretty disappointed in The Silent Patient. Not because it's not very good -- and I don't think it's very good -- but because so many reviews are so exuberant, and so much buzz and attention surround it. It really worries me about the state of public taste and an understanding of quality. So, without being too snarky ... it was painful to get through this. Every scene, character and almost every sentence is a cliche. It's a very flat story in that it's all shown from the perspective of what the protagonist(s) see at the moment; there's no subtext, no resonance to anything other than the one dimensional present. My guess is Mr. Michaelides wrote this as a screenplay then decided to novelize it. The ""snappy"" jumps from one ironic comment to the next scene shriek of cinematography, and while there's nothing wrong with that, a novel should have some depth beyond the immediate surface. Every timeworn scene is in there -- the scary old house with the mysterious stranger at the window; people jumping at you from the dark for a ""boo"" moment; the kindly old professor who seems to have every musical instrument stuffed into his office, including, yes, a harp; the loose floorboard in which a secret clue is hidden (how many loose floorboards do you have in your house?). Mr. Michaelides also seems to like the word ""bitch"" a lot, which is kind of disturbing -- he has a lot of the characters describe women this way, and it's unpleasant. He also has only one description for most men, which is ""well-built."" But it's the cliched writing that's really hard to slog through; some examples (no spoilers, I hope): ""If looks could kill, I would have dropped dead;"" ""She devoured his kisses hungrily;"" ""A chorus of bells started ringing in my head, clanging, chiming, reverberating."" Oh my! Another problem I had is motivation. In a convincing story, people do things based on human reactions and emotions, and no matter the subject, if we as readers identify with the motivations, it's all the more engaging. Mr. Michaelides lays out his characters and their motivations in a sort of legalistic way, i.e., all the evidence and facts are there, but it's as though he's never met a real human before and is jotting down their behavior as if from a textbook. It's hard to identify with any of the cliche'd characters because they operate so far from human reality. Now, I wouldn't be this critical if this was some run-of-the-mill mystery. But the magnitude of the praise seems totally at odds with the quality of the work. I only finished it because I paid $18 and wanted the payoff. And there is one. It's a TWIST, but it's sort of like twist #6, and you can see it coming about a mile off. So I was disappointed -- not so much with Mr. Michaelides, who presents a solid if uninspired product -- but with the clamor of critics and reviewers who tell us this is something great. Also note -- A.J. Finn, whose name and praise are all over this book has been revealed as a liar and somewhat of a scam artist. I would guess a good number of the great reviews you are seeing are paid and/or manipulated. Finn is not good company to be in right now, and if I were you, I would give careful critical eye to the praise here. Something's not right.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

It reads like a cheesy Harlequin romance novel, with so much filler, it’s hard to remember what the actual storyline is. The dialogue with other therapists at the Grove is so childish, I almost could not read any further. Several times, Alicia is referred to as “a bitch” by doctors—I cannot imagine why the author chose to depict them as so blatantly unprofessional and adolescent. It’s quite disgraceful to the profession. I stuck this book out, entirely because our book club chose it for the month. The more I read, the stupider I thought it was. I actually feel cheated for having spent full price on it. The conversations between people are poorly scripted, juvenile and unrelated to the storyline. The trite little sex scenes—-like a cheap trashy paperback. I’ve never rolled my eyes more than I did with this book. Every time the main character Theo says anything, he sounds like a teenager with a first crush. The famous plot twist at the end is deflating, at best. Predictable and ridiculous. The whole diary thing reminds me of a high school essay, covered in red ink reprimands from the teacher, having been given a barely passable grade of D+. Unbearable. I’ve always known that movies that get overhyped are usually way below par. This book is a perfect example of some great marketing through decent testimonials, but in the end, lacking any substance. I would hesitate to recommend this book to anyone.

I can't stop recommending it to people, even my guy friends.After reading the author's note I'm not sure how anyone can consider this anything but a masterpiece. ""When friends ask me what Beach Read is about, I tell them it's about a disillusioned romance author and a literary fiction writer who make a deal to swap genres for the summer. When other writers ask me what Beach Read is about, I tell them it's about writer's block."" Personally, I think I would describe this as a complicated adult contemporary romance about two authors finding solace in each other at a time where they are both dealing with a lot of emotional baggage.I understand why some reviews say this wasn't the type of romance they were expecting. The cover and title are a bit misleading. This is definitely not a light and fun summer read. There's a big focus on writing and craft, a book about writing a book you could say, but it also examines grief and mourning. It hones in on how differently people see the world and why some of us are more pessimistic/optimistic than others. Who are we - bright lights or black holes? How do we cope with knowing that happiness is not guaranteed?The developing relationship was a slow burn. I lived for every knee bump, nose nuzzle, breathy ear whisper, and pretend nonchalant touching of skin and limbs. The sex scenes were intense but poetic, exactly how I like them.Emily Henry's writing was easy to devour but also lyrical. Her primary and secondary characters were all so well written, flawed but evolving. The witty banter was top-notch. There were many things I loved - the perfectly crafted references to books and movies, the notes they held up for each other from one window to the other, the hesitancy to ask questions, intimately getting to know someone you think you already have all figured out then realizing how wrong you were, allowing them to challenge and change your perspective. I laughed. I cried. I was at the edge of my seat. I felt it all on such a deep, human level.I finished this yesterday and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

I thought this book would be a simple way for him to learn pen control and maybe letters, but I was wrong.

I was super disappointed because it was an advertised page and I expected more like it. There is no other creative tracing activity in the entire book.He was confused by many of the shapes and designs and thought he should color them in, and any time I was helping his sisters he was flipping pages and scribbling.This book is NOT engaging for early learners, unless they are particularly interested in writing. I took a picture of the side of the book to show the actual content dispersal. The purple is learning pen control. You can see it's such a small portion that it's almost not visible. Orange is all tracing letters, and pink is all tracing numbers. It jumped way too quickly to letters and numbers for me.I wound up getting him a wipe-clean book from Usborne instead, which focuses much more on shapes and pen control, and he likes it much better.

That was before her boyfriend dumped her, her father died suddenly and everything she thought she knew about happiness turned out to be an illusion.Now she left with nothing but an old house on the lake and a rapidly approaching deadline to deliver her next book, she packs up her entire life and heads to wilds of Michigan.  She mistakenly thought she was buying herself time to come to terms with who her father truly was.  The very last thing she needs is to discover that she’s now living right next door to her infuriatingly handsome college nemesis.January remembered Augustus Everett as Gus or Sexy, Evil Gus depending on her mood. Even back then, his writing was lauded by staff and students alike.  Their artistic clash fueled both her imagination and her passion. Until the night when she almost (but not quite) surrendered to his charms. Saved from diving headlong into a sea of humiliation by her best friend, she could never forget the chemistry that sizzled between them.When their old rivalry sparks a bet that will have both stepping out of their comfort zones, the result will either culminate in the salvation of her writing career or the breaking of her heart.  And the odds aren’t in her favor.Beach Read isn’t the light summer romance that it appears to be at first glance.  It’s a story that’s far deeper and more profound.

Animal Farm is a small book at only about a hundred pages, but the ideas it conveys are monumental.George Orwell not only provides a compelling story with relatable characters but also layers it with a political commentary that reflects not only the Russian Revolution, but rather the tendencies inherent in all mankind.Even a child could read this book. The language and voice used is clear, concise, and enjoyable. However, a child may not know why the animals refer to each other as “comrade.” Likewise, they may not understand the anthems referred to by the song “Beasts of England,” or the allegory inherent in the notions of “animalism,” the seven laws, the design of the flag, or the ideas behind the animals’ rituals/ceremonies. They may not understand the stories Moses spreads about “Sugarcandy Mountain.”They don’t need to. Despite being laden with these weighty concepts, the story is interesting and simple on the surface, and even if the concepts escape some readers, the story will spark the imagination and stimulate the mind.

But I'm doing it anyway, obviously, because I really liked this.  It's a contemporary romance with a clever plot, slow-burn romance, and more substance than is usually found in CRs.The plot features the writing of books, writer's block, and a little bit of a sounding off about the validity of romance and women's fiction.  If you are a reader of romance, like me, you have probably encountered many (snobbish) people in your life who don't share your opinion and, more to the point, may even belittle it.  Nonetheless, I ignore them and persist in my reading.The heroine of this book, January Andrews, is a 29-year-old romance author.  She believes in happy endings and makes sure all her books have one.  Unfortunately, she has recently received a blow in her life.  When her father unexpectedly dies, she inherits a lake house she was unaware existed, and also learns that that lake house was his ""love nest"" for an extramarital affair.  January feels as betrayed by her father as her mother was, no longer believes in those HEAs, feels her whole life has been a lie, and is suffering writer's block.But she's broke and needs somewhere to live, so she moves into that lake house, hoping to get her mojo back somehow.  Well, it turns out her next-door neighbor is Augustus Everett, well-known and successful author of literary fiction which definitely does not have happy endings.  He also is having a bit of a struggle at the moment with his life and his next book.  For inspiration, they decide to try writing in each other's genre.  He'll do the HEA novel and she'll go for the realistic one.To accomplish this,they'll go on research trips together.  He takes her to the site of a former cult that suffered a tragedy and to interviews with survivors of the cult, and she takes him on romantic outings.  Will this break the writer's block?It must be said that Gus and January already knew each other years ago at university, when both were aspiring writers.  There was antagonism between the two mixed with physical attraction, and both the antagonism and the attraction are still there in the here and now.Both characters have baggage from their pasts which make the course of their fall-into-love difficult.  This is a nicely realistic story and what's especially appealing to me about it is the fact that it's quite the slow burn.  There's no falling into bed first before the falling into love.  They take their time getting to know one another.  And they take their time to get a handle on the problems of their pasts that are interfering with their presents.",True,romance,Language.ENGLISH

We just finished The Lightning Thief today, and I have to warn you: If you’re expecting something as good as Harry Potter, you will be highly disappointed with this book. It’s simply not as good as Harry Potter in nearly every way imaginable. The characters, pacing, and storyline have nowhere near the complexity or sophistication of Harry Potter.This book felt like a real drag, and I am trying to figure out how to tell my kid I don’t want to read the rest of the series to her, as I constantly find my mind drifting away while reading because it feels like reading (surprise surprise) children’s literature.To the author’s credit, my kid does seem to enjoy the book much more than I do. But today she told me, “Percy Jackson doesn’t hook the reader, and it felt like it took forever for anything to actually happen in the plot line besides monster attacks.”So maybe if you’re 9, this is a five-star book. If you’re a parent, be careful before committing to reading the whole series to your kid, as it may be a big fat drag. And please stop saying this series is as good as Harry Potter, because it is far far farrrrr from being on the same level.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

But then they went their separate ways and Elliot never heard back from Macy and now she's back in the picture again. I was eager to find out what happened between them and why Macy was so afraid to pick back up despite Elliot's eagerness. What did he do and what did she do? I couldn't fathom that Elliot did anything wrong from what I learned about him, but at the same time, I was on Macy's side because she had been through so much and needed someone in her corner.

You'll find yourself thinking ""She/he would never have said that."" or ""He/she would never have done that!"" It just doesn't track with the characters we knew so well. Fans of the books will be very disappointed in the script. Firstly, it's not actually a novel (duh) and it doesn't read like one (also duh). Many will blame the format for the departure from her past quality and while it clearly didn't do Rowling et. al. any favors, this reads like fan-fiction. Start to finish. The new characters, the changes to old characters, the plot, the concept - all of them scream ""fan-fiction"" and not even good fan-fiction. The key points of the story just don't fit the universe. It's uncomfortable to read this if you're deep into the original stories. You'll struggle to fit the actions of characters into what you know of them. So much of the plot feels like a retread of old material and not just flashbacks but the themes. This didn't add anything new to the Harry Potter universe. At least, nothing that we couldn't have lived without. There are a few brief moments that feel like the wizarding world we all know and love but sadly, they are few and far between.

But the rainbow fish as a character isn't, like, a greedy CEO who was stealing from the community and denying everyone vital care and fair resources or something like that. He's just...an otherwise-ordinary member of the community who grew different scales. He didn't ASK to be different. The moral appears to be: ""sharing is good."" Sure, okay. But this is a really terrible framing for that otherwise-useful moral. It isn't at all something like, ""Hey, wait, this rainbow fish is somehow taking advantage of our community/ecosystem to GET those scales unfairly"" kind of thing! The scales that he distributes don't ACTUALLY benefit the community in any actual way beyond just satisfying the egos of the other characters. I wish the rainbow fish was sharing something like toys, and maybe learns that some toys are more fun with a group? That could be a better way to frame this ""sharing is good"" lesson. But as-is, honestly...how dare the other fish in the story be like ""hey, rainbow fish, give me access to your body because I'm jealous of you."" And how dare this book frame that as a good thing, a happy ending! Kids deserve to set boundaries ESPECIALLY with their bodies and their appearances and this book tramples all over that. Look, the art and the use of foil is gorgeous. But kids' books don't need to just have lovely art and pictures. They need to have carefully-crafted, intelligent stories.

It was literally a page turner that I could not put down. But now that I've completed it, I've got to say that I am THOROUGHLY disappointed. The writing is lazy. I don't know who's more at fault - the writer himself or the editor. Each character introduced lacked thoughtful character development. One after the next, we get to know each character at surface level with lackluster plot lines. Amelia's journal entries were reminiscent of what we saw in Gone Girl and other books of this genre. This to me is where the real laziness came in. Providing journal entries as the gateway for the reader to understand the character is a fabulous idea when executed well. Each entry left me thinking ""what does this tell me that the narrator hasn't already explained?"" It felt as though they were crafted by the narrator himself, vs. the character who I'm supposed to believe wrote them. My last and greatest disappointment comes from the fleeting attempts at symbolism & significance. The snowstorm, the Greek tragedy, and Amelia's artwork specifically. Each are referenced as something of importance, sporadically appearing throughout the book. Sadly, each one lacked the real ""A-HA"" moment of realizing its true significance to further tell the story.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH
11830,451526341,5.0,"Animal Farm, an Extremely Engaging, Dystopian Novel",2 people found this helpful,"Animal Farm is a dystopian book by George Orwell about a farm full of animals all overthrowing their alcoholic, abusive farmer, Mr. Jones, in hopes of creating a better society within the farm, where everyone is equal. This execution is much harder than how the animals imagined it, and their seemingly perfect world slowly turns more and more into a society run by totalitarianism. Another book made by the same author, George Orwell, is yet another dystopian novel by the name of Nineteen Eighty-Four. Both of these books both involve communism, which could be representing Orwell’s political views. The story starts with three pigs, Old Major, Snowball, and Napoleon, as the main animals in charge, leading the revolt and helping all the other animals create a carefree, peaceful society. This leads the audience to believe that the three of them are the protagonists, and the antagonist is Mr. Jones, the farmer mistreating the animals. But on the contrary, the protagonists are not what you would think, as revealed later in the story. There are many plot twists incorporated, keeping the story very interesting. The character development in Animal Farm is fantastic and shows drastic changes. This book is very well written, always engaging the reader and keeping them wondering what is going to happen next.

What I didn't expect was how truly awful the writing was. Repetitive descriptions, poorly drawn secondary characters, implausible plot turns.

Maybe because I used some strong words, I was really upset after reading it and having wasted my time and money. I will try to tune it down a little. The book is presented as a classic whoddunit, but it is not. We discover only at the end who is the victim (although at some point it becomes obvious) and when the murder is described, we learn immediately who is the killer, so no mystery to solve. The comparisons made to Agatha Christie are completely misleading. But it's not just this that makes it an horrible book. 99% of the book is the story of some young adults behaving like horny and superficial teenagers, obsessing about sex, and getting constantly drunk. The book is full of cliches, the characters are all bad stereotypes, and they are completely unrealistic: a mother who does not care about her childrens left at home, worries about her marriage, but nonetheless flirts with other guys, a groom who flirts with several women present at his wedding, and I could go on. Trivial events, such as a drinking game, or a toast at the wedding, are described with overly dramatic tones, becoming grotesque, maybe to justify that this is supposed to be a thriller? Speaking of which, episodes that should be scary are just utterly ridicoulous. The story in non-existent and the characters so annoying, unlikable and shallow, that at 1/3 into the book I just started skimming through, just to see how much worse it could get.

I am a Harry Potter fan, even if I recognize that it is not great literature, it is highly entertaining and solidly written. I do not have an issue that this was a play script and not a novel. I was prepared and acknowledged that many of the important pieces like the ambiance of Hogwarts and the ""wizard world"" would be missing. Where I draw exception is how entirely inconsistent this story feels. The characters don't feel or read like those we've come to love. The plot is juvenile. For those few of you who love Harry Potter (and haven't read this play yet), you may just want to stick to the original seven books and leave your memory of Harry unsullied by this unnecessary addition. SPOILER TIME: Ron's character was a ridiculous. I know many people think he was a little superfluous in the books, too, but now he's just there for comic relief. Unfunny comic relief, at that. Cedric being humiliated once and becoming a Death Eater? I cry foul on that one. As a character, Cedric was noble enough to tell Harry about the egg, humble enough to admit that Harry had helped him, and kind enough to allow Harry to win the Triwizard tournament with him. Cedric constantly tried to limit his own father's pride, yet one humiliation turns him into a Death Eater? Not buying it. While I really didn't like the idea of Voldemort's child, it was obvious from the time she was introduced who she was. I mean, she was THE ONLY influential new person in the entire play! Let's not get into the whole time turner thing. That was the best they could come up with? Such a contrived plot device. And for pity's sake people, you can't just go whipping up Polyjuice Potion from ingredients someone has in their house; it takes a month to brew! This was a significant plot point in ""Chamber of Secrets."" Rowling; why didn't you catch this!?",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

I loved the original Harry Potter books, and I even thought The Casual Vacancy and the Galbraith books were pretty good. Unfortunately, this reads like bad fanfiction. My favorite characters appeared in name only, with none of the depth, charm or interesting dynamics that made the original Potter books so compelling. Perhaps the lack of character development could have been saved by an interesting plot, but the Cursed Child lacks that as well. The storyline is driven by how growing up in the shadow of his father, Harry Potter, makes Albus Potter a dark and tortured soul. Although Albus' siblings seem perfectly well adjusted (basically mini-Fred and mini-Ginny), Albus suffers from ANGST, causing him to pull incredibly stupid stunts that advance the plot in the absence of any logic or reason. Clever, creative world building could have possibly saved this illogical story with flat, annoying characters. And yet the writers fail to add any dimensions to the HP Universe, instead using old set pieces (that I used to know and love) in ways that make no sense while simultaneously sucking all the whimsy and wonder out of Magical Britain.

I was on the fence about reading The Proposal until I saw that it was Carlos’ love story, at which point my interest was up 1000%. Although I had to speed read this book to make sure I finished it before my ebook was returned to the library, I thoroughly enjoyed it; I probably would’ve read it nearly as fast without the time crunch.I loved Nikole and Carlos right away, and had so much fun reading their story. I loved their banter and inside jokes and the generally sweet nature of their relationship. (Now the thought of sour cream makes me giggle. If you know, you know.) I also really liked Nik’s friends, Dana and Courtney, and how they roasted one another so frequently but were still, without fail, each other’s biggest cheerleaders. (And reading about Courtney’s cupcake shop has me craving cupcakes. I don’t have cupcakes. Crap.)In both books I’ve read by Guillory at this point in time, I’ve noticed some conversations with rather cheesy dialogue, though I can overlook that since her books are so much fun to read. What I can’t overlook so easily is the surprising amount of similarities between her protagonists and love interests. Each side character is unique, but the same can’t be said about the stars of the show. Alexa, Drew, and now Nikole and Carlos are all very driven people, hard-working but still very social, that for some reason or another aren’t looking for a serious, long-term relationship. Both The Wedding Date and The Proposal go about like this: two attractive people meet, want sex, have sex, like it enough to continue having sex, catch feels, realize they caught feels, bail on said feels, mope about until their friends encourage them to kiss and make up, then actually kiss and make up, the end.I know romance novels are usually formulaic to some extent and I don’t mind that. Over the last several months, I’ve grown to love them despite the fairly obvious patterns, and find them very comforting to read. However, something about this specific situation, with these specific books, just feels janky to me, and I wanted to mention it.That being said, it didn’t stop me from loving this book or adding the rest of the books in the series to my TBR, and it certainly won’t stop me from recommending this book to others.

I can see why LOVE AND OTHER WORDS connected with so many readers, but I didn't entirely feel the same level of adoration to the story as a whole.Through past/present storytelling, Christina Lauren takes the reader on a journey back to Elliot and Masie's past from when they first met through when they fell in love and later fell apart. Eleven years after their breakup, the two meet again and Elliot is just as in love with her as he was as a teenager. But one problem—Masie is engaged.Christina Lauren almost always writes delicious red-hot chemistry with great banter and dreamy heroes. Those things are present in Love and Other Words. Even though Elliot's character fell into the ""too perfect to feel real"" category, I still swooned hard over his intelligence, nerdiness, and sweetness. Lauren built up their love story as children so well, showing the reader how these two bookworm nerds fell hard for each other over the course of several years. I loved reading their past love story. In a way, we got a what I like to call a ""double love story"" because we got to see them fall in love twice. This book made me feel addicted to it because I kept needing to know what happens next. I love it when that happens!This is Christina Lauren's first foray into women's fiction, so I was curious to see how their writing talents transferred into this new genre for them. My biggest question was how they were going to craft the conflict. In the past, the conflict in some of their stories hasn't been the strongest, which causes the whole story to deflate when it should be exploding.In an attempt to explain away some of the plot contrivances, Lauren asks the reader to believe a lot. Somehow, Elliot didn't know that Masie's dad had passed away. After being best friends for years and deeply in love, Elliot didn't aggressively attempt to reach out to Masie. On the flip side, Masie didn't want to talk over what she saw with Elliot? I don't buy it. If she was that in love to drive hours to see him that night, that same girl would have been pounding at his door and shoving at his chest screaming, ""WHAT THE HELL?!"" Neither Elliot nor Masie ever met their mutual friends in nearly six years of friendship, until the night they broke up. Masie was engaged when she sees Elliot again. But it's a little too convenient that her fiancé is not really that in to her and was totally fine with her ending it.Both characters felt like the same character type we've seen in other Christina Lauren type books. We have the really nerdy sensitive guy and the female professional whose profession didn't really play a part in her character. Though, I did like see Lauren write a story with everyday people, instead of high-powered executives we've seen in the past. With this being billed as women's fiction, I was expecting to see more of an interplay between Masie's profession and her life as well as a more developed emotional arc for Masie's character. Neither of those things really occurred here. To me, this felt like more of a contemporary romance and less like a women's fiction novel. Also, Elliot's life in the present isn't really explored in any detail either. I couldn't even tell you what he does or what he likes (aside from Masie and literature).I really didn't like that we find out that Elliot had been essentially raped, yet this trauma wasn't explored or dealt with in any way whatsoever. Rather, the focus was on the breakup between him and Masie.I did enjoy reading their love story as teens and seeing them reconnect in the future. If you're a die hard women's fiction reader, this book may leave you wanting more. But if you like second chance romance, then I'd recommend you give this one a go (with some reservations), especially to meet the adorable Elliot.",True,romance,Language.ENGLISH

We follow our protagonist, Guy Montag, as he contentedly goes to work everyday and burns books. Sometimes, if there are many books, he and his fellow fireman burn the entire house down, and they do it without question. One day, that question is posed by an eccentric young girl named Clarisse, who challenges Guy’s notions of why he lives the way that he does. He begins to realize that everything in his life is censored to keep him from thinking. The reasoning is ostensibly that hard and difficult thoughts and ideas (like those held in books) make people unhappy, as it forces them to think. As an added example, his wife spends all day at home with her “family,” which is really just a wall of televisions that keep her entertained and thus unthinking. I found it poignant that even in the early 50’s, television had been identified as a tool for media barons to spread mass influence, especially when you consider the addiction that television and media has become in today’s age. So, Guy pushes back against the system in control (by reading a book) and he is subsequently pursued as an outsider. His life is turned upside down, he flees, and by the end of our story, he finds himself amongst the rebels. These “rebels” are former college professors and intellectual thinkers who have been cast out of the system and now live in the forest as homeless men. Their mission in life, and how they show their resistance, is by remembering. They remember the knowledge of old, things that used to be held in books, and their hope is to someday bring humanity’s collective intelligence back to the forefront of society.What I really liked about this book was the thought put into the characters. Sure, Guy is your average guy, as his name suggests, and his wife is cast as the sucker of the system, refusing to be enlightened and instead choosing to live in blissful ignorance (at one point in the book, Guy is raising his concerns about not being happy in their shallow lives, and his wife responds “I’m tired of listening to this junk” and promptly turns from Guy back to her television program.) But I found it impressively accurate that the initial crack in the facade came from youth. At a certain age, people seem to come to a form of societal acceptance, and I loved that it was essentially a child who came along and finally asked the all important question: “Why?” It made me wonder, what do we adults lose by forgoing our ability to continually ask this question, both of ourselves and the world around us?Another character I liked was the fire captain Beatty. Every dystopian novel needs an antagonist and this is Beatty’s role. However, while it makes sense that the haggard professors comprise the resistance, Beatty is also an educated man having read many pieces of literature and views the information in books in an opposing light. He has found them to be endlessly contradictory, and thusly tools of unhappiness, and has found comfort in his mission to destroy them. I found it fascinating that the author showed learned characters who, when presented with the same world-choices, made opposing decisions. I think it really goes to show the differing wisdoms of individual people. Two people can read the same book, and while one can love it and the other hate it, both can be correct, because it is (in most cases) a subjective medium.Now, framed as the antagonist, some might say that Beatty took the ‘easy’ way out. But would it also be appropriate to suggest that in a world overflowing with chaos, he accepted the path of least resistance? Would there be merit in a condemnation of his choice, or should we opt for mercy? Or neither, and should we, as both readers of fiction and also members of our current society, accept his decision and the reasons behind it? I don’t have answers to these questions, and I think it wise not to try and decide. Instead, I think we should all periodically ponder them, especially as we find ourselves making similar decisions in our own lives, and watch others close to us do the same. Society doesn’t move forward when we force our opinions onto other. True merit is born of the perpetual quest for understanding and always asking why?",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

Sure, I have a buddy that runs some games (that's why I picked this up), have dabbled in the past with other friends, and I have played BG2, Icewind Dale, and NW and NW2 into the ground, so I know my D&D.  As a dad with a full-time job, I just don't have the time or energy to spend 3-5 hours every week after work dungeon crawling.With that background in place, I find this book to be an absolute breath of fresh air.  This is a great ruleset for someone without the time or ability to really delve into a character, or for a group to quickly set up a crawl on a cold winter weekend.  The rules have been streamlined from my days with 3.5e and Pathfinder (they are a touch simpler, much more efficient, and involve very few negative numbers).  More importantly, the rules put quite a bit more emphasis on roleplaying and acting a part.  That is not to say the depth is gone.  Not even close.  It is absolutely still there for the GM and others if you want it (just look at some of the other reviews and Wizards own running blog to demonstrate that), particularly if you look at the other books and really get into the feats and adventuring sections of the PH.Best example of how this ruleset is different than previous iterations: I can look at my wife and say ""sure love, you can play an elvish barbarian if you want,"" knowing that it will actually be fun for her.  She might still stink compared to a min/max half-orc barbarian, but the rules are much more forgiving of such oddball characters.  They seem to WANT you to try goofy things like that and just play it out!On top of all that, the book has nice art, is well designed, and a good read (if you enjoy rule books).

I love how educational this story is and how perfect it is to initiate educational activities about butterflies with your child. We've read it so many times, but now that she's a bit older, we've created butterfly life cycle collages, done story sequencing activities with it, and we even purchased a live butterfly garden that allowed her to see how a real butterfly transforms .

14144,63076098,5.0,Better than I figured,11 people found this helpful,"Well, the name really says it all. He truly tells a great tale. It has all of what you want, and will pull at many emotions. Many musicians have wild stories about crazy parties where anything goes, this is not one of those books. Instead this tale covers many of things in life that you may not expect it to. It begins with childhood tale of growing up and doing things kids do, but is mostly about life post Nirvana in my opinion. While he does tall some stories from those years, it’s more his take on how he got there and less about Kurt Cobain, RIP. While Kurt’s tale is a gripping one, you can find it easily elsewhere if by some freak of nature you aren’t already well versed on that part of the story. Tragic as it all must have been for those so close, this is a happier tale of the life and times of one of the greatest musicians alive and kicking. I have not enjoyed a book this much in a while, mostly only reading for the sake of learning. I wanted a light read that would be fun and this book delivers what I was seeking to find.I get a strong sense that I can relate to in this book. He is always very proud and thankful to have led the life he has, through each up and down as they came at him full force. He repeats throughout a feeling of disbelief at the places he had been and the things he has been blessed enough to experience in his life. Not that I ever had any other opinion of him, but you can tell he is truly one of the nicest and most humble musicians to tour the world. While luck may have played into it now and then, Dave really is where he is because of his amazing raw talent and his attitude towards the world and life. I would love nothing more than to spend a little time with this man just shooting the bull about music and family, things he is very passionate about for sure. He seems like none of his fame has gone to his head the wrong way and he should be very proud of what he has accomplished. Not many would have continued in music after such a loss as he must have felt, but we all have a great catalogue of music to enjoy because it worked out so well.The book has is more somber moments, the death of childhood friends, family, and band mates is enough to bring tears to most people I’ll bet. Most tragic is knowing the entire time that following the release of this book his best friend and fellow musician Taylor Hawkins passed away while out on tour. It makes his pain seem much more impactful, but I’m certain he will once again pull through as he has been able to before. Each and every person he has lost would want nothing more for him than to continue down the road of success.All that aside, the highlights of the book for me are the way he describes his idols and meeting them, the way he describes his beautiful family, and his description of building his basement studio where some of his singles were recorded. Glad I’m not the only guy who nailed a sleeping bag or two to a wall for a little control over sound. Knowing that the first album for the Foo Fighters was recorded in a little home studio not that far off from the one I have built brings me in and helps bring the stories to life. His stories about Sir Paul McCartney playing with his daughter on the home piano and when he played for both McCartney and GW Bush are another high point for me. Dave might wonder how he ended up playing such a gig but I wonder how anyone else could be a better choice. I would be balling my eyes out if one of the Beatles was playing a song with my kid, but it’s no surprise he would be friends with Paul to me. I wouldn’t feel I was on that level either but Dave, you fit right in there.As a musician, however meek in comparison, a lot of his story is very relatable and hits home. I believe his mothers love snd support along with his taking life as it comes and not controlling every little thing made the difference between him and someone like me. That and the fact I would have been too scared to take such a chance at a young age as he did. Dave is a great person, it’s evident in the stories and how he tells them as well as from those I know who have met him and told their tales. Plus, it’s great to relate to him in that I play many instruments as well and value many things he values in life. He must have a blast touring the world and yet all the money and fame only seems to make him more humble and caring, which is something to aspire to for sure.Ever since I first heard him hammer his drum set into oblivion on Saturday night live I have known he was great and would achieve great things. I can’t wait to hear what happens next for him. Rock on, that’s all I can say. I will be reading this again and will then pass it on to my son to enjoy. What an inspiring man he is.Fully recommmend this to anyone who is a fan of music and life.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

The plot is centered around time travel, quite possibly the most cringeworthy storyline cliché imaginable and completely passes over the essence of the series in the first place. Throughout the first few acts the reader is constantly being jerked around in a half-assed attempt to catch them up to speed, and the sparse snapshots of life that we are shown do little to rival the sentiment of merely watching an episode of Full House. I'm thoroughly convinced that anybody who rushes to the defense of this book is so intransigently entrenched in fandom that they couldn't work past the guilt of having grown up with Harry Potter to even consider slandering this abomination to an incredible series.

6110,133821666X,2.0,I feel duped,25,"Absolute disappointment. I feel like I was duped. I did very very little research on this. I knew it would be taking place 20 years down the road from the last books, and I knew it was technically just a screenplay, not an actual book. But I failed to realize it wasn't actually written by Rowling. I should have known, and I should have saved my money. Being that it was a screenplay I originally wrote it off, knowing it would likely to let me down, it would lack the depth I wanted. But the hype of release reeled me in, and the endless ads spouting, ""Harry Potter is back, read the eighth book"", lead me to buy the kindle edition so I could read it immediately. Oh what an utter waste of money. It is absolutely nothing like the originals, even if it was a proper book. None of the characters seem like themselves. I understand that they all have done some serious growing up, but it all seemed very out of touch. Only later did I find out that it would appear that Rowling didn't even have much of a hand in it. No wonder it sounded nothing like her originals. It really seemed like poor fan fic. It was so cheesy and childish, and just kept replaying old scenes, playing with time travel, making it so it was not original at all. It was so predictable. I kept trying to give it a break, telling myself that it's meant for the stage, it would probably be better there. But there were moments, that even on stage would have been terrible. To me, it's clear Rowling did not have much of a hand in this. It can not be put in the same line as the other books, and should not be considered part of the series at all. *** SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT *** One of my biggest issues was the gift Harry decides to gift Albus. Why oh why would a teenage boy want his dad's ratty old baby blanket? Really? It was just clear that was in there for the plot later on. It didn't make any sense whatsoever. So predictable. They go back in time to return and find one of their good friends was never born? How original. They go back in time to a dark world where evil prevailed? What a surprise. Never read a book where that sort of thing happened... Ugh. Lazy writing is what that is. And the bit with the trolly witch on the train? No other kid, Serious Black even, couldn't get past her, but Albus and Scorpius (oh and really, that name, Scorpius? While I loved the character, that name... I couldn't get past it) were able to jump off really without any problems. And come on. These two kids and a twenty year old girl could not have broken into Hermione's office and library so easily. Please. She was incredibly smart when she was a teenager. You are telling me, now, 20 years older, she doesn't have some impenetrable safe guards in place for her office? Or at least a more difficult riddle to crack. What a joke. She's smarter than that. Further so, I don't think Harry would have been such a terrible dad. I understand he didn't really have a ""dad"" to look up to, to guide him in his own path of being a parent, but I don't think he would have been this d-bag dad. And what was with Dumbledores breakdown? How awkward. Again, so out of touch with the original character.

8504,B0176M3U10,4.0,Finally read it after months on KU Romances,19 people found this helpful,"So much hype over this book! I've read dozens and dozens of KU Romances across every genre - billionaire, mafia, same sex, enemies to lovers, second chance, dark, light, everything in between. There is some really good content over there so I finally wanted to see how they compared to one of the best selling romance novels of all time. Selfishly I also wanted to see how Hoover's writing (this is my first of hers i've read) compared to Sylvia Day whose Bared series I loved Books 1-3.Overall I give this a 4 stars. It didn't completely bowl me over but overall really good. One little admission is that I totally skipped the pages and pages and pages of ""journal entries"" aka back story for Lily and Atlas, and guess what? Still was able to figure out the story just fine :) It came across to me as filler and really slowed the plot down but I know some readers love those juicy details. I just wanted to get back to the main story line and honestly some of the entries were like 12 pages long. If you wanna do the same, I won't tell anybody and I promise you won't be lost.Spoilers ahead.This book honestly wasn't as dark as I thought it would be given all the talk of domestic violence. I thought it would be scene after scene, but there were only 3 incidents in the whole book, 2 of which were somewhat unintentional and/or partially happenstance, while the third was just nauseatingly purposeful. Some of the MC (Lily) reactions seemed a little fake or contrived, and especially I DID not like it when she informed Ryle WHILE HE HELD HIS NEWBORN BABY that she wanted a divorce. Surely she could have waited a day? I don't like when books make me dislike a protagonist and up until this very point at the end, I had really liked Lily.Ryle and his thought processes were right on. Having experience with men with major emotional trauma this really hit home for me and seemed incredibly realistic. There are two types of abusers in my opinion - the ones who are truly mean and don't care that they are hurting others and the the ones with the demons they can't control. Him putting on Lily by saying ""help me"" as though its up to her to heal him was really on point (if very, very wrong - he is responsible for his own healing).Anyway, overall pretty well done if a little too much filler in the middle of the book. The ending was pretty superb and that Epilogue! I have to admit I was rooting for Atlas the whole time, but I have a weak spot for rescuers. Unfortunately I didn't really get invested in any of the characters enough to want to spend the money or time on It Starts with Us, which starts where EWU leaves off. I think I'll move on to Ugly Love which I heard was steamier and is a little more along my preference lines.TBH if you are looking for pure drama and emotional angst Sylvia Day's Book 1 of Bared series is going to leave you gasping, its way more fast paced. Unfortunately though the series drops off in quality after book 3, and one thing CoHo fans love is her consistency.HTH!",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

We had so much fun with our first few sessions with the Starter Set, that I knew we needed to move into the full rule set. The cheaper price here on Amazon was a bonus.

The entire book had a thick layer of Sad that tampered my enjoyment because my expectation going into the story was “feel-good summer romance.” Which it wasn’t. Not very feel-good, and I didn’t think it was funny, either. I also didn’t vibe with the chemistry between January and Augustus. Okay, I’m done being grumpy. Ugh.

And there is nothing to admire about the main character. The back of the book said, ""Evelyn Hugo is the glamorous idol you admire, but she's also the relentless fighter you aspire to be"" - US weekly. Nothing is further from the truth. The front of the book quoted Emily Giffin saying that it is a novel about ""...the price of fame."" It's a novel. There is nothing in the book that is about any real famous person's life. It is simply Reid's imaginary, pretty unlikable, famous person. Skimmed the end to see if there was anything redeeming and throwing it away.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

Regular romance readers may not enjoy this due to some of the darker undertones and deeper conversations within it. However, I believe this is what made me love this book in it’s entirety. This is how real relationships are. They are messy and deep, but also full of laughter and experiences that make them grow closer.January and Augustus went to the same university and both became writers, but always critiqued each others creations due to their differences in writing styles. One creates romance that a “fairy princess” would enjoy, while the other writes literary fiction with the aims of exploring the darkness of humans.January moves to the beach house on the lake after her father dies and she discovers his dark secret at his funeral.And of course I’ll give you 2 guesses of who lives next door…So how do these two start to bond? By trying to see the world through each others eyes, making a bet, and creating their next work of fiction based in the others “field of expertise”.Augustus takes January on research trips regarding a cult and January begins planning the most romantic dates she can think of to try to warm Augustus’ heart.But what secrets are they not telling each other, and why does Augustus have to be so damn sexy?!",True,romance,Language.ENGLISH

I have to admit I have never seen Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. I requested this book when I learned it was about Trevor Noah's childhood in Apartheid South Africa.I started reading my ebook galley as soon as I was approved.I have to love a guy who finds comedy in tragedy and who gleefully spins yarns about experiences that would keep most of us in therapy for a lifetime. There is a genius in comedy that allows us to encounter devastating truths through the protective lens of laughter.The heroine of the book is Noah's mother, a feisty lady with a solid rock faith, a gal who snubs her nose at things that don't make sense. She makes mistakes, but always out of love. She takes huge risks but somehow Jesus is always there to catch her mid-fall.Noah was ""naughty as s***"" and a challenge to raise, but never hateful or mean. He learned to navigate Apartheid society's complex system that divided people in to three groups: black, white, and colored. How one was categorized was senseless. Japanese were put into the 'white' slot but Chinese into the 'colored'.""The genius of Apartheid was convincing people who were the overwhelming majority to turn on each other. Apart hate, is what is was.""Noah was 'colored' with a 'black' Xhosa African mother and a 'white' Swiss father, his very existence implicating his parent's crime. Had the police discovered them, his parents would be sent to jail and Noah sent to an orphanage. He spent much of his life hidden away, indoors. His parents could not be seen together with him, and his mother had to even pretend he was not her child.Noah was ""colored by complexion but not by culture."" He spoke multiple languages, Xhosa and Zulu and Afrikaans, and English, could fit into most groups, but felt affiliated to black culture.The book is a series of episodic tales, thoughtfully constructed, saving the climax of his family history until the end of the book, after we have come to know and understand them.""I saw the futility of violence, the cycle that just repeats itself, the damage that's inflicted on people that they in turn inflict on others. I saw, more than anything, that relationships are not sustained by violence, but by love.""The book is funny but is more than a diversive read, it enlarges our understanding of the world. Noah offers an understanding of South African history, colonialism, and Apartheid that is engaging and relevant. He shares the important things he learned and offers them to us. We should listen. We should learn.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

10988,1984806734,4.0,4 Stars - Really good,9 people found this helpful,"I just wasn't sure about this one when I requested it. The cover is that stinking animated trend that I really dislike. I don't always read adult books due to potential content, but I've learned that just because a book is labeled adult doesn't mean it has to include graphic content. I'm not familiar with this author (although I am interested in looking into her other books). But the description had a few things going for it that pulled me in. I loved that both main characters are authors, and I also liked their bet/challenge about stepping out of their normal genres to write something different.January is disillusioned. Her father recently passed away, and on the day of his funeral she found out that he'd had an affair while her mother was fighting cancer. And her long-term boyfriend couldn't handle her journey through grief and betrayal. Struggling with writing anything romance-driven, she's in a financial bind as well. So January moves temporarily into her father's lake house to empty it and sell it...while also writing a book.January quickly realizes that her next-door neighbor is Gus Everett who she went to college with. Back then, Gus repeatedly criticized her writing because of her perpetual happy endings. He also chose to only critique her during class which caused a lot of resentment. Yet there's always another side to the story.I loved the insight we're given into the writing and even briefly into the publishing process. This isn't too detailed. It didn't take over the story, but I think Emily Henry included just the right amount of both the story January was writing and the process itself.Gus was endearing. He's awkward. He sees the world in a darker way than January does. Yet he's drawn to her light. There was not much that I didn't like about Gus.I don't always address this because I feel like I would be repeating myself in 90% of my reviews, but there were certainly many moral decisions in this book that I don't personally support. My thoughts on many of these things the majority of our country would consider outdated, but that doesn't change the fact that I hold to a different moral standard than the average American (or so it seems these days).Favorite quotes:-It wasn’t that I couldn’t get enough of him. Or that he was the best man I’d ever known. (I’d thought that was my dad, but now it was the dad from my favorite 2000s teen drama, Veronica Mars.) Or that he was my favorite person. (That was Shadi.) Or because he made me laugh so hard I wept. (He laughed easily, but rarely joked.) Or that when something bad happened, he was the first person I wanted to call. (He wasn’t.) It was that we met at the same age my parents had, that the snowball fight and impromptu road trip had felt like fate, that my mother adored him. He fit so perfectly into the love story I’d imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life.-Anger with all the broken parents, heartache that they too must’ve felt like kids—helpless, unsure how to make the right decisions, terrified of making the wrong ones.-“You don’t believe in any kind of internal moral compass.” The way he said it made it seem as if he himself did believe in such a thing, which would’ve surprised me a few weeks ago, but now made perfect sense. “Maybe you start out with that,” she said, “But if you do, it gets shaped as you age. How are you supposed to believe right’s right and wrong’s wrong if everyone around you says the opposite? You’re supposed to think you’re smarter than all of them?”-“You don’t know the difference between pity and sympathy,” I said. “I’m not pitying you. It makes me sad to think of you being treated like that. It makes me mad to think you didn’t have the things all kids deserve. And yeah, it makes me mad and sad that a lot of people go through the things you went through, but it’s even more upsetting because it’s you. And I know you and I like you and I want you to have a good life. That’s not pity. That’s caring about someone.”-You make beautiful things, because you love the world, and maybe the world doesn’t always look how it does in your books, but … I think putting them out there, that changes the world a little bit. And the world can’t afford to lose that.”These quotes remind me of a few things I want to mention. The second quote is a reminder that I now read from a parental figure's point of view just as much as the main character. I can't turn it off. The third reminds me that I can't base what I believe to be right or wrong upon myself or anyone else or even a large collection of others. God's Word will always be my moral compass. I have and will fall short. But I at least have a guide that does not waver. The fourth is a pet peeve of mine. Characters in books often disdain what they perceive as pity, but sympathy is usually what's being extended to them by people who care. And those people don't have to be in their close inner circle to care. For the last quote, I fancy seeing myself writing a book one day. And if I ever do, I hope that my characters or my world might not be realistic so much as hopeful or portrayals of what can be.Beach Read was much better than I expected it to be. I really enjoyed the process of the relationship between Gus and January. I appreciated her journey through grief and beginning to heal. I also liked the information surrounding writing, the process, and the publishing side we get to see. I do have to say that I didn't love the information dump in the form of letters January's father wrote to her before he died. Beach Read gets 4 Stars. Have you read Beach Read? What did you think?

I'm sorry, but he mostly annoyed me, his obsession with Alicia Berenson and his marriage problem. And, from the beginning is it clear that he's not that mentally sound so I wasn't surprised when ""things"" happened towards the end. I felt that the story was just idling along, it never picked up the pace and neither Alicia's diary entries nor Theo's POV really grabbed my interest. At least it was pleasant enough that I could finish the book. Now, of course, there must be some twist to the story and sure enough, when the book was nearly done did it show up. And, yes I have to admit that it was a clever move, alas a bit too late for me and frankly not especially imaginative.

12752,1451673310,5.0,In Defense of Digital Books,2 people found this helpful,"An awareness of a film remake of  got me digging into this story once again; it was written 65 years ago when I was in the 6th grade and books said it all! Bradbury said that this was the only science fiction book he had ever done and that it was based on reality, what he described as ‘the art of the possible’. I couldn’t remember from the first time I read it how he had dealt with the ideas of book burning and discontent so I went back and reread his original so that I might get to the heart of digital books today.This 1953 novel emerged from his concerns over the threats of the McCarthy era and the historical role that book burnings have played in suppressing dissenting ideas. It describes the dehumanizing of a society where books are outlawed because of the disagreement that they spread. The job of censoring these works and destroying such knowledge was that of the firemen who would burn them. It is considered one of his best works. At the time, he described it as a commentary on how mass media may reduce interest in the reading of literature. The 60th Anniversary Edition of ‘Fahrenheit 451’ was an exciting find for me because in it the original story is supplemented with an assortment of commentary from other admirers and from Bradbury himself.Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them, at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us. — Ray Bradbury,Guy Montag is the main character, who has been a fireman for ten years. The story’s focus is on his questioning of his inner thoughts and the dialogue that he is having, or doesn’t have, with his boss Captain Beatty, his wife Mildred, his intriguing and now missing neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, his new-found friend Faber, a retired English professor, and ‘five old men’ that surfaced. Two other items bring their unique coloring to the story, the Salamander fire trucks, complete with fire throwers, and the Mechanical Hounds.I was delighted with Neil Geiman’s Introduction; his words reaffirm the timelessness that the story brought to me. I was born between Bradbury (1920) and Geiman (1960) and I went back to reread the book, already questioning how a story that was written in the past about the future could truly hold up for today’s generation in a world that’s already been dramatically shaped by time and technology in ways that they weren’t even aware of. In he 1950’s, Bradbury already saw computers possibilities in simple terms and saw that nothing but good would be coming from them. He believed that, in a sense, computers were simply books, were all over the place and that computers would be as well.A familiarity exists in the conversations and the silences of the story that is easily recognized as the firemen discuss their work, their lives and the complexities of their relationships; those surroundings seem timeless. The images of Mildred’s ‘family’ in the parlor are quite similar to the multiscreen environments that typically surround us today. Look around you; computers and smartphones count! The relationships that we still have with books goes without saying; they’ve been with us for centuries. The idea that all books could become criminal has always been an absurdity to the masses but the historical role that book burning has played as a means deleting or controlling differences and dissidents is real. ‘Fahrenheit 451’ is a novel first, a fiction, a story about a dedicated fireman, Montag, who believes that all books cause conflicting ideas and must be destroyed. He is part of a zealous effort to purge their existence from society. After meeting Clarisse, he begins to question how his beliefs have been shaped and his curiosity inspires his quest for meaning in words. By story’s end he has become the revolution and a hero for the future of books… just like Bradbury!!I was struck by Bradbury’s comments in Coda (1979) of how he waged a lifelong battle with well-intentioned readers or the actions of cubby-hole editors, fearful of contaminating the young, blatantly changing his words or suggesting that he do. In one instance, he discovered that, bit-by-bit, some seventy-five separate section had been censured from Fahrenheit, causing the entire book to be reset. His point should be obvious; there is more than one way to burn a book and the world is full of people running about with lit matches!This book contains an unprecedented collection of timely wisdom from noted experts from the world of words just in time to bolster my efforts to promote storytelling in today's younger generation, not the least of these are from Bradbury’s own perspectives.Bob Magnant created the Fingertips Series on iTunes to promote the reading, writing and reviewing of books in the digital age. He has written multiple Apple iBooks and is the author of 'Domestic Satellite: An FCC Giant Step' and '', a fact-based novel about Iran. He writes about politics, globalization, the Internet and US policy and lives near the beach in Jupiter, FL.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

5060,1984806750,1.0,Predictable & Boring,,"I really disliked this book. On the basis of a friend’s recommendation, I previously read Beach Read by Emily Henry and disliked it. I thought perhaps this book, being her second novel, would be better. It wasn’t. The story is told is mostly alternating chapters of “this summer” and previous summers, going back six summers ago, all from Poppy’s POV. Poppy and Alex are platonic friends who take a summer vacation together each year, at least until two years ago when something happened between them, and they have not spoken to one another for the two years since that last trip. What happened is the only mystery in the book. The rest is predictable. Over time, the reader finds out what happened two summers ago and the only mystery is solved. Honestly, it’s not that big of a deal. The “this summer” chapters are the main plot of the book as the couple do agree to take a summer trip together, and of course, the most obvious outcomes occurs. The writing has numerous issues. There are a few POV shifts, even mid-paragraph, which were disturbing to the flow of the prose. There is a plot hole regarding the vehicle with the flat tire. One minute they were on the side of the road with a flat, next minute they were back to their hotel. What happened to the car with the flat tire is never explained. The characters were typical millennials with their entitlement attitudes and feelings of ennui. I didn’t care for either Poppy or Alex. Neither were a character I could pull for. Poppy’s character was fairly well developed, but Alex’s character needed more development. I would like to have seen chapters from Alex’s POV to further know his thinking. A minor quibble is the overt drug use detailed in the book. I didn’t feel it was necessary and took away from the story Henry was trying to tell. Also the gay characters seemed forced into the plot just so the book could be LGBTQ friendly, but again, they could have been omitted and it been just as good of a story. The ending felt rushed. Henry did a decent job of showing us the scenery, characters, and the action, until the end. She switched to a more narrative telling of the details to finish the book sooner. If she needed to cut material, there was plenty she could have cut and made more room to improve the ending. I cannot recommend this book as it was disappointing.

January is a romance author, who is currently having writers block, and is having money problems.  The house is a surprise, as she discovers the father she always loved, was also having an affair, and owned this beach house with his mistress.  January has problems coming to terms accepting the truth about her father, especially with her mother still alive, having recovered from cancer, and her mother never told her about his other life.  All of this make it even more difficult for her to write happy ever after romance novels.Gus Everett, our hero, is January’s next-door neighbor, and the two get off on the wrong foot immediately.  Gus is also a writer, but he writes literary fiction more towards dark story lines, and he too has his own issues writing his next book.  They are both totally opposites, as Gus is more pessimistic and January is an optimist, though things will change.In a short time, they begin to get to know each other, and a friendship will develop.  The banter between them was cute and funny, and with both of them unable to write, they decide to help push each other by making a bet.  January will take Gus to romantic field trips, dinners, to teach him how to write a romance novel with a happy ending.  Gus will take January to meet people who have suffered a loss, visit a grave yard or meet someone involved with a cult.  The bet is for them to write something different, and whoever sells their manuscript first will win.What follows is a romance between two people who had their own issues with family, leaving both of them somewhat damaged.  In a short time, they both will move forward past their friendship to love.  Gus comes off of a divorce, and his fear of getting hurt again keeps him from making the next step toward his relationship with January.  January has her own problems dealing with her feelings of betrayal by her father, and though she knows she loves Gus, she too is scared to move forward. During this period, they enjoy each other’s company, as they do all the things together that require research for each of their novels. There was a lot of fun and bantering between them, and we knew they were perfect for each other.Emily Henry has written a wonderful story of two people who deserve happiness and each other, but there was much heart wrenching angst, betrayals, secrets, and pain that made it difficult.

Everything felt like a dungeon crawl better built for the Blizzard great but on paper and those two shouldn't be put together, they work well in their own environments.I am glad to see them shifting back to a bit more of the RPG days but leaving in some of the good things they did learn in 4.0 and it looks like they learned a bit.

There were some things that I found a bit far-fetched procedurally and some of Wise's actions weren't very wise or professional, considering she was a retired FBI agent.  For example, continuing to involve herself after she had been taken off the case and drawing DeMarco in as well.  Continuing to question and bait a suspect she knew was dangerous, rather than backing out and calling for back-up.  Neither are good ideas, but it seems she had a history of that kind of behavior while with the bureau.  It begs the question, ""How did she make it to retirement?""I also found her ""relationship"" with Allen, awkward in the extreme.  Their conversations were painful, but maybe that was the intention.

Worst case scenario, it can be used to teach kids to allow Horrible abuse to continue, bc you want to be liked, don’t you so you have to give people what they want... no way, my kid won’t be taught to be used and be a doormat. There are much better books to teach sharing, humility, and equality.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

Almost every alternate sentence in the conversations, ends with a question: like, is it not? Does it not? Was he? Could it be? … ad nauseam. The twists in the story appear to be highly contrived, or, “manufactured”. One person, single-handedly tying up two persons to chairs is unrealistic, even for story. The story too is bleak and black. It is about a psychotherapist and a patient. After reading the book, the reader may most probably decide never to go to a psychotherapist in his life.

6923,451524934,3.0,"Hope Rises, and is Beaten to Death in this Depressing Classic",,"Hmmmm.This book strikes multiple chords in me.At first, it is dull and depressing, yet my spirit rose against the injustice and lies surrounding Winston.Then, my heart leapt with hope for more, for love, romance, connection, rebellion against the lies and domination.When Winston first connected with Julia, my heart leapt with joy, yet the constraints on their relationship left me famished for more intimacy, more connection, more selfless giving, and collective courage against the injustice of the government gone awry.Throughout my heart rebelled against the idea of succumbing to such lies, such injustice, such bullying, such cowardice and inability to stand out or to act.Yet a glimmer of hope arose in their relationship. Part of me longed for them to remain in the place that allowed their relationship to grow in secret, and another part wanted them to stand out and risk all to fight against the machine.Yet as the body is dragged downward after stepping off a cliff, my heart was taken down as events spiral and build toward in a crescendo of hopelessness, loss, and disappointment....and another thread emerged, one that was always there, but beneath the surface, almost resisted, yet never quite. Yet it rose up, and a sickness seized my mind and heart to have my thoughts drug along in such rabble of nonsense, lies, distortion, cowardice, and pain.In the process, I felt my heart and mind rise further in rebellion to any injustice, any lie, any bullying by those in power who would twist reality and people to suit their purposes. I resolved anew to never yield, to stand against this, and to stamp out bullying, injustice, and perversion wherever encountered, no matter the cost, may God help me in this resolve.In the end, I rate this book three stars.Some parts of it are five stars, such as the connection with Julia, the hope that hardly dares to rise its head at the budding of their relationship, the beautiful way they cling to each other against all hope.Other parts are one star, such as the ranting and drawwwn ouuut ramblings of perverted politics in places, and the prolonged injustice and perversion of O'Brian and others who stand with no opponent to champion truth.This leads me to a three star rating, since I cannot rate such a depressing and seemingly pointless book with five stars, yet I cannot rank a book too poorly that so successfully raises the soul to impossible hope before smashing it and stamping it lifeless in the dust.In the end, I am not sure whether I recommend it at all.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

Either their writing has improved immensely and/or this is a genre that they should keep working in. Twenty pages in and I had a very strong feeling that I was going to really like this story.Told in alternating past/present, the past is slowly revealed as two previously best friends/young loves meet again after being separated by a traumatic event(s) 11 years prior. Macy and Elliot were strong and realistically drawn characters that I felt connected and endeared to right from the start. As with most women's fiction, secondary characters play important roles to the story and I felt that strongly here. The cacophony of Elliott's family in contrast to the subdued quiet of Macy's and how they both found love and solace from each other's worlds was enjoyable to watch. The slow building of Macy and Elliot's friendship were some of the highlights with their shared joy of reading, communicating honestly and the sharing of their favorite words. Their current ""favorite words"" became vital and directly related to the moments they were sharing. To my relief, the conflict of their present ""love"" interests are there, but resolved quickly, giving the much needed time for contemplation and resolution of Macy and Elliot's relationship. I wouldn't necessarily say that this was a perfect book, but I was wholly invested and enjoyed every minute of my time spent in it.",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH

These thoughts were the opposite of what made sense but more of what they wanted to believe. The belief that everyone is malleable into an ideal citizen was what O Brien wanted to instill in Winston.The book was amazing, there was lessons of , love, rebellious acts, betrayal, and beliefs.

It reads like a cheesy Harlequin romance novel, with so much filler, it’s hard to remember what the actual storyline is. The dialogue with other therapists at the Grove is so childish, I almost could not read any further. Several times, Alicia is referred to as “a bitch” by doctors—I cannot imagine why the author chose to depict them as so blatantly unprofessional and adolescent. It’s quite disgraceful to the profession. I stuck this book out, entirely because our book club chose it for the month. The more I read, the stupider I thought it was. I actually feel cheated for having spent full price on it. The conversations between people are poorly scripted, juvenile and unrelated to the storyline. The trite little sex scenes—-like a cheap trashy paperback. I’ve never rolled my eyes more than I did with this book. Every time the main character Theo says anything, he sounds like a teenager with a first crush. The famous plot twist at the end is deflating, at best. Predictable and ridiculous. The whole diary thing reminds me of a high school essay, covered in red ink reprimands from the teacher, having been given a barely passable grade of D+. Unbearable. I’ve always known that movies that get overhyped are usually way below par. This book is a perfect example of some great marketing through decent testimonials, but in the end, lacking any substance. I would hesitate to recommend this book to anyone. I found it insulting, much like giving a 12 - year old a ‘See Spot Run’ book and telling them how wonderful it is, and how much they’ll get out of it.

From the very first chapter I knew this was going to be an unforgettable read, and boy was I right. It was simply sublime.This is a different book we are used to reading from Christina Lauren and it really showcased the talent these two authors hold.  These characters and this story were so fresh, so lovable, so memorable. It's a story of living a childhood filled with both pain and wonder.  About finding that one person you connect with through the happiest of times and the most trying of times.  About an unbreakable soul-deep connection you can never break, no matter what ups and downs you experience with that person.  It's a story about forgiveness and love.  A story about learning to let go of the past and embrace what the future may hold.  A story that is so well written you will connect with every word on every page.  I don't know how these authors do it, but they manage to create worlds that capture a reader every single time.  There were so many reason to love this story.  Macy is an honest and vulnerable gal. Elliott is her total equal in both of those respects. Together they begin as two beautifully endearing kids and grow into interesting and admirable adults.  Unfortunately, there is a painful moment that interrupted their relationship and after years apart fate sees to it that they have the chance to mend what's been broken between them. What starts out as a relationship of innocence and first love turns into a beautifully emotional and lasting bond built on the love they found when they first met. Truly a love story for the ages!   If I'm being honest, there's no way I can adequately tell you just how much I adored this book!

6771,125030170X,2.0,not great,,"When I began this book I couldn't stop reading. Somewhere around half way through I saw the end. I love twisty plots that are clever and surprising. However , this was not that sort of book. A writer can easily lead the reader down a road of thinking the main character is one way (good,evil), then start revealing the true character and intentions little by little . This works when the character's thought process and mannerisms stay the same. You get that moment when you realize you misjudged the character all along. That this character is not who you thought they were. This book fails to provide the ah-ha moment because the writer changes the character's thought process. This is not clever. This is not even slightly artful because anyone can do this. Elementary school writing. Anyone can change a character's mind and thoughts to reveal evil intentions.

I had to force myself to get through it.The plot is weak and has holes, too many questions left unanswered, the story was rushed, and the characters actions were out of character (primarily Harry.) It just seemed as if the attention to detail and rich storytelling that we are accustomed to with Rowling were missing. This one missed the mark.

True, the central mystery is a veritable page-turner and there is a, pardon the pun, killer plot twist at the end. However, one of the most significant elements upon which the plot hinges is so ludicrously conceived and executed that every time it was re-introduced made me lose further esteem for this author. I'm referring to the titular character's personal diary or journal, passages from which interrupt the main subjective narrative of the story. Who on earth writes a diary loaded with character descriptions and stretches of dialogue worthy of, well, a mystery novel? Each diary entry becomes more of an eye-roller than the one before and eventually robs the plot of any trace of credibility. It's like a TV police procedural that introduces pivotal CCTV footage that's shot with elaborate and implausible camera setups, tracking shots, and closeups.

Refer, then, to page 191: ""In the long run a hierarchial society was only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance."" (This is the rant of the ficticious Goldstein.)Now read Jon Jeter's ""Flat Broke in the Free Market,"" ""Armed madhouse,"" by Palast, ""The Man Who Sold the World..."" by Kleinkrecht, and, of course, the ever popular blockbuster of international poverty ""The World is Flat"" by Friedman. So, I will leave it up to you, gentle reader, was Orwell a prophet of distinction or a paranoid socialist nutcase? Have you already visited Room 101?The book is marred by lengthy and didactic dialogue and the premise  ""They"" would spend money to force Winston to love Big Brother before whacking him.  Stalin, and rest of the politicians, dictators, and religious leaders would not have spent the dime.But, at least, as yet, our ubiquitous screens only broadcast and do not monitor, although there is some very distressing information out there about electronic surveillence.Now, one of the local teachers complained to me that he was expected to be teaching exactly the same thing the same day as all the other instructors in his field.  ""Why don't they just use a DVD?"" he complained.  Now, it just so happens that Uncle Mitch, and I will not tell you who he is if you do not know, just announced that every student could have virtual charter school education just by plugging in a computer (Thus, eliminating teachers, teachers' unions, pension plans, school building maintenance, etc. for the public from this personal taxes).You can bet the DVD would be broadcast from some third world country where the techs would work for food, while those who will rule over us, including Uncle's offspring, attended private schools, probably funded by public tax money.  You can also bet a shiny new dime that ""1984"" would not be in the curriculum.So, the question again is: Was Orwell a prophet of distinction or a paranoid socialist nutcase?Either way, this book seems almost as fresh today as the day it was written, and, as distressing as this title is, should be on your required reading list.As an addendum: Readers may wish to revisit Orwell's earlier work ""Animal Farm"" to discover that ""1984"" is really just an enlargement of that previous publication, although the names have been changed to protect the guilty.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

Foley has simply recycled her cardboard, cliched characters from `The Hunting Party', changed the names and PC details and plugged them into relationships with the SAME EXACT DYNAMICS as in `The Guest List'. These books seem to have more in common with a paint by numbers kit than a creative endeavor. Eventually, I just started laughing out loud as yet another setting, character, and plot point resurfaced with the scantest of disguises. It's not that funny, though, as I notice that the book is on the NY Times Best Seller list. That this mediocre rehash has sold so well is truly dispiriting. What is also not so amusing is that, since the Quarantine I've been buying books (library is out for now) so I purchased both `The Guest List' and `The Hunting Party'. Instead of `Two books for the Price of One!' it's more like `One Book for the Price of Two!'. I actually feel ripped off. I am tempted to go through all the ways in which these two books are the same but that would involve spoilers and it might make the book more enjoyable for some to spot the recycled parts on their own.

She goes up to live in it when she is broke and still is working on her current novel--or rather not working on it.  Her next door neighbor is Gus Everett, her rival in college.  After taking potshots at each other, they decide to have a contest where he writes a rom-com and she writes a literary novel and see which one can sell theirs first.  In the course of their writing, truths come out.I loved this book!  I loved January.  I could relate to her as she and Gus have their discussions at the end of their days of writing.  I understood her thoughts.  I also loved Gus.  He is similar to January but his thoughts took on a darker tone.  Once January can get him to open up, he reveals a lot to January--things she never expected.  I did appreciate their openness when their thoughts and explanations came out.  It is rare to have that much communication between characters.  His explanation when they went to New Eden was wonderful and swoon-worthy.I loved the other characters--Pete, Maggie, even Sonya.  They are quirky (not Sonya).  I was glad when Sonya made January listen to her.  So much was said and pain was let go eventually.  I wish January's mother had been more open with her earlier so her father's death would not have been a shock.I liked the humor.  There were times I was laughing out loud as I pictured these scenes.

10659,1984806734,4.0,Much More Than a Beach Read,,"I loved Beach Read. It's pretty much that simple. I had no idea what it was about when I started it - I knew it was one of those ""must read summer books!"" so I bought it. Based on the cover and the title, I thought it would be a frothy rom-com set at the beach but it was so much more than that.January Andrews is a romance book writer whose perfect life is shattered when her father dies and she learns he'd been having an affair. Soon her relationship is over, she's broke and has writer's block so she heads to the lake house her father left her which happens to be right next door to the home of Augustus Everett, a highly-acclaimed writer of literary fiction and January's nemesis from college. I could tell you more but you can see where this is going, right?Books about writing are always favorites of mine and I love the fun Emily Henry has with the tropes of the different genres. Like January tells Gus ""Happy endings don't matter if the getting there sucks"" and the getting there in this novel does anything but. Both January and Gus are grappling with issues that feel authentic and play out with emotional twists I really didn't see coming. Their witty banter made me laugh out loud several times and while it may seem over-the-top to some people, I believed two smart writers would talk that way. Henry's pop culture references are also a hoot - ""So far, this was the third worst day of my life, and that January was probably buried wherever they put the old Taylor Swift"" slayed me - but the story also has a lot of heart and the characters are introspective in a way I don't come to expect from a ""beach read"" like when January talks about her ex - ""He fit so perfectly into the love story I'd imagined for myself that I mistook him for the love of my life.""Don't judge this book by its cover (or its title) - if you're looking for a light, meet-cute, this may not be the summer read for you. But if you want a meet-cute that's smart and some substance, you'll love Beach Read as much as I did.4.5 stars",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH

11795,451526341,5.0,Amazing story,One person found this helpful,"This book offers a simplified and darkly humorous demonstration of the dangers of the governments decent into tyranny. George Orwell has perfectly mirrored the disoriented victory that was the Russian Revolution and then the woeful moment when the peasants, (portrayed as farm animals)  put their freedom in the hands of the government, believing that the government would make them all equal.  The story perfectly relates that it was but was only a matter of months until the animals are told by their government that although all animals are equal, some are ""more equal than others"" in the case of the book, this ""more equal"" animal was Napoleon, the pig, who soon caused mass starvation. In the case of the Russian Revolution the ""more equal"" person (although animal may be a more fitting word) was of course Vladimir Lenin, who killed millions of his ""comrades""  in gulags. George Orwell's Animal Farm also perfectly relates to the Chinese Resolution which left Mao Zedong as the ""more equal"" man ruling the country, and we all remember how he, in his ""humble equalness"" forced about 10 million peasants into deadly labor camps as a wicked scheme to make the country rich (a scheme that is still being used in China today).

The motivation from both child and parent has to be there, in order to get the most out of it. We call it “doing school work” and after almost two months, we’ve had to regulate her to doing only 4 pages per day...otherwise she gets too excited and exhausted. Combined with other things related to numbers and letters, she’s flying through the worksheets. A helpful thing for us was to color the larger pictures  together because she only wanted to do the matching and tracing activities.When we are finished, we will buy another of the same and start all over again to perfect the skills and see if she can do the worksheets with less guidance. She will likely do two or three complete books before we move on to another workbook.I have to say I LOVE the clean tearing.

I liked the rhyming text, and the laughter it caused. My group of children LOVE to read humorous and silly books, such as the Pigeon series by Mo Willems. When I received this book and opened the first page, I was shocked by the illustration of a donkey with an artificial limb, similar to those of accomplished athletes like Amy Purdy or Noah Galloway, who also competed on Dancing with the Stars. The so-called wonky donkey with three legs actually has four legs; one of them being a prosthetic leg. I closed the book and didn't bother reading any further. I would never read this book to the young children in my class. Learning that having a prosthetic leg is a reason to laugh at someone for being ""wonky"" is not something I want to teach young minds.

The social commentary rings hollow, the characterizations are poor, and the story seemed rushed, as if she had a deadline to fulfill and wrote the whole thing in a week. I couldn't connect with any of the characters, and the NYC she describes is what you would expect from a mediocre writer with poor powers of psychological or even physical observation. (I'd know, because I've lived in the tristate area for 20 years and have read great books set in the city. Let the Great World Spin by Colum McCann is one).

6078,133821666X,2.0,Harry Potter and the Perils of Ascended Fanfiction,3,"The Harry Potter series of books (the seven ones in the main series and the three ""Hogwarts Library"" complimentary ones) are popular for a good reason. They're not your ""flavor of the week"" fad and they're trend setters rather than followers. They're timeless, engaging, well written mystery novels that are far more interesting and smarter than the movie adaptations make them look (not that the movies are BAD, quite the opposite, but people who are only familiar with the series through them are certainly missing a lot). Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, referred to as ""the eight story"" is none of that. It's certainly not a book, since it's a play, so what we have here is a rehearsing script. Now that's fine. It's understandable, expected and I have no problem with it. The problem is everything else. Unlike the books, this story is derivative, predictable, self-indulgent and dumb. It has many of the characters seen in the original books, but they're there in name only, since their personalities are certainly not the same. Also long gone? The smart writing, the nail-biting mystery, the sense of adventure and anything close to actual life-lessons, replaced with childish attempts that border on humorless parody. This story is fanfiction, and it falls into its most notable pits, doing no effort to avoid them. Let me give you an example. Picture you and your significant other are shopping and you say: ""Hey, we should buy milk"", so she/he replies ""We can't do that, we have no milk!"". Spot the lapse in logic there? How you offer a solution to a problem and the other person replies by simply stating the problem which you're giving a solution to? Note how preposterous that is, and how dumb it would be if you just accepted it? Let me show you the example on the book: Two guys and a girl are about to use a Time-Turner to travel back in time. One of the guys proposes an idea: GUY: ""... we're going back without any knowledge of whether we can travel back afterwards... maybe we should just - try going back an hour first, say, first and then..."" GIRL: ""I'm sorry, GUY, we have no time to waste."" No time? NO TIME? You have a freaking Time-Turner RIGHT. THERE. Time is what you have THE MOST of. More than anyone else. Heck, the entire idea he was giving you was to MAKE TIME. Your response makes no sense! And the fact that neither of the guys point it out is even worse. Now this might sound like nitpicking, but this particular bit of dialogue showcases the main problem with this strictly plot-driven story: logic is set aside because the plot demands things happen. Characters will go against their personalities because the plot demands things happen. This is just one of the many aforementioned pits of fanfiction. Here's a short list of others: - The Mary Sue: this is a character that has no flaws, can't fail and always has the right thing to say to solve a situation. - The Obvious Villain: this is the character that you will easily peg as the villain the moment they show up even though the story treats it like an unexpected twist when it's revealed. A telling sign is that they're too eager to make the plot advance. - The Derivative Callback: what's a writer to do when he wants to evoke the same feelings from a work someone else started without having any idea how to write well? Simple, he just writes scenes that are similar to ones created by the original writer in hopes that the memories of the previous ones will be enough to give readers the same feeling. In this particular case, this gets too on the nose when two guys and a girl use Polyjuice Potion to sneak into the Ministry of Magic to steal a trinket. I wish I was kidding. - The Manufactured Drama: this one's obvious. Drama has to happen, so while two characters could talk like normal people instead they choose to either stay silent or break character just for it to occur, because the writer has no idea how to bring it naturally. - The Forced Pathos: a writer wants the reader to feel sad, but he can't write compelling drama, so what does he do? Simple, he repeats sad scenes that the previous writer created. The difference with The Derivative Callback is that these aren't just similar, they're literally the same scenes, step by step, shown either by flashback or time travel. - The Superpowerful villain: a writer wants the stakes to feel higher, so what's he to do when he can't write compelling characters or situations? Well, he gives the villain incredible powers, of course, whether these make sense in the story or not. ""Oh, you thought the previous villain was powerful? No, here's version 3.0, that old geezer has nothing on MY guy! What's that? That there's no precedent for this kind of power in this universe? Blah, I don't understand those words, look at the fireworks!"" - The Ship: Sigh. I, of course, mean ""ship"" not as a vessel, but as a verb, as in ""I'm going to pair these two characters together wheter it makes literally no sense or... wait, ESPECIALLY if it makes literally no sense"". This is probably the most known one in fanfiction (so much that it has its own subcategory, called slash fiction), but it's especially painful here. Once you read who's certain person's father you'll know instantly who the writer decided would be the mother, even though, again, it makes literally no sense. Please understand that I gave this story a fair chance. I was actually very excited for it, I preordered this book back in February. I knew it wasn't written by J.K. Rowling, but I also knew she's not the only good writer in the world, so I gave this what I thought was a well-deserved opportunity. Instead, I was ""rewarded"" with having to read what appears to be some blogger's Harry Potter, Back to the Future and It's a Wonderful Life's fanfictions all rolled-up into one. Make no mistake, this is amateur writing at its worst. I have nothing against fanfiction. I've read some very, very good Harry Potter fanfiction in the past, but for the life of me I can't believe writing this poor ever got such a chance. I absolutely don't recommend it, but if you HAVE to read it, then go prepared. Adjust your expectations as low as possible and you might draw some enjoyment out of it. But it will still never feel like the touted ""eight story"".",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

11178,399587683,4.0,Fun contemporary (diverse) romance,,"Note: an eARC of this title was acquired via NetGalley.Y'ALL.Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely adored The Proposal. Jasmine Guillory is a fantastic writer, full-stop, and her sophomore novel was a fun contemporary romance that treated its characters (and readers) like competent adults. There was dramatic tension, but it didn't feel like the characters made stupid, dumb choices JUST to move the plot forward. They communicated with one another the way people do in real life and disagreements happened because of what each character SAID to one another, not because they didn't talk to begin with. (Such gasp. Much shock. So horror.)Both the two leads and everyone else were diverse in some way, but no one's backstory or motivations felt contrived or there to only serve a narrative purpose. Like, this novel was just so refreshing and makes you question the romance genre as a whole. Why can't other novels have functioning adults as their protagonists? Why can't there be more than just straight white people falling in love?? Why can't more intersectional stories cross over into the mainstream???I was definitely aware of Guillory's debut, The Wedding Date, earlier this year (an #OwnVoices contemporary romance raved by Roxane Gay!), so I really wanted to read The Proposal as soon as it was published. (Because duh that cover and that summary.) AND LET ME TELL YOU. It delivered. The Proposal could have been any other romance, but because Guillory is so precise in her characterizations, it made sense that THESE characters in THIS setting had THESE things happen to them. The sex scenes weren't gratuitous but they didn't feel safe for work, either. And I know the timeline in which her protagonists fall in love is, in theory, very short, but it's also like why is this taking so long?? 👏HUR👏RY👏UP👏Honestly, the only thing that I disliked was that the damn book ended. I could see that the pages left were getting smaller and smaller, but I was also like no??? maybe don't?? And then when Nik and Carlos FINALLY get their Happily Ever After, I turned the page and there was a biography of Guillory instead of more story.

I'm very happy to see Jennette speaking out about this topic and hope that this book can help shine a bigger light on child abuse, something that is not taken as serious as it should be.

Reading Jennette's book made me feel like I was reading about my own mom on those pages. Personally, I was pretty unphased by most of the content because I can relate to it so much and it was basically ""normal"" for me to deal with that stuff from my mom growing up.

It started off fun and easy to read, until it all came crashing down to such disappointments. It was boring than I expected.

That being said I did read it and I am amazed that women in 2022 would think it good. The 'hero' is an abusive, domineering, foul mouthed jerk. Is this what women want? He engages in a pull - push 'romance' with the heroine who is too soft to survive. She does toughen up slightly over time but then lets herself down by giving into the 'hero' thinking she is in love. Throughout the story he grabs her, drags her, pushes her - seriously is this woman not allowed to move of her own volition? He doesn't know what he wants and uses and gaslights the 'heroine'. He is not sure he wants her but he gets angry whenever any other man wants her. He is also very fond of the F word. Now to my mind there is a use for the word such as when you drop a brick on your foot, the dog runs away, your fiance is found in flagrante with the bridesmaid or the children set fire to the house. Even the liberal use of the F word seems acceptable to me in those sort of circumstances.

11435,451524934,5.0,A classic novel about a fascist world gone mad.,2 people found this helpful,"This classic utopian novel depicts a mad, fascist world, where truth is controlled by the government, and independent thought is illegal.  Compassion for others is punishable by death; the only love allowed is for ""Big Brother"" who is always watching you through telescreens that permeate everywhere.  The world is divided up into three superpowers, East Asia, Eurasia, and Oceania, which consists of the Americas and the former British Empire including London where this novel is set.  The world is in a constant state of war.  All social and technological progress has halted.  All humanistic values like peace and love are crushed.  The fascist government has complete control over every aspect of people's lives, including their thoughts.The people are in a perpetual state of poverty.  The proles are the ignorant, listless lower class.  The Outer party is the middle class, where our protagonist, Winston, resides; they do most of the so-called professional work for the Inner Party, though still live in abject misery.  They work grueling hours in tiny cubicles, delivering misinformation to an ignorant public.  (Sound familiar?)  Sex is not to be enjoyed by party members; it is only for procreation.  (Does this sound familiar?)  Any violation is constituted a sexcrime.  The English language is being stripped of words, butchered, and consolidated; OldSpeak is being translated into NewSpeak, a simplistic language consisting of compound words like DoubleSpeak.  The people are incited into anger against their opponent in war and Goldstein, the leader of an imaginary opposition.  It is a fascist world that crushes what is left of humanity. Winston, likely named by the author after Winston Churchill, is a middle-aged man working in the Outer Party.  He begins to rebel against the fascist state by writing a journal in secrecy, committing thoughtcrimes, and entering to an illicit affair with the young Julia.  He is betrayed by O'Brien, an Inner Party member, who seduces him with the truth.  Winston and Julia are caught in bed and sent to the Ministry of Love, where they are tortured and brainwashed.  In the end, they betray each other, and Winston confesses his love for Big Brother. This is a haunting, depressing novel, but a very important read.  The political allegories can be applied to society today; it is intended as a warning to us.  This novel is engrossing, thought-provoking, intelligent, and very-well written.

She should already know the girl is trouble yet arrives in this little town, parks her car, then leaves her handbag in it with her phone and of course, is surprised to find that it's all been stolen. She's just as surprised when she gets to her hotel room and finds it ransacked and everything of worth gone. Well, everything but an 11 year-old smartass, the surprise offspring of said evil twin. The male protaganist is the quintessential macho-male type, projecting much beefiness and hotness (her words) that leave her swooning despite her animosity towards him. I am stopping now because with all the angst building up between these two characters, I fear a sex scene coming on and I just can't bear the thought of reading about it.

26617,133821666X,2.0,Harry Potter and the Cursed Book: Mediocre fanfiction.,2,"You know those fanfiction stories you read where you start off thinking they're going to be good, but slowly realize that they were probably written by a 12 year old who is obsessed with cheesy dialogue and emo-ness, and wouldn't know a good plot if it hit them in the face? That is what this is. It's a bit harsh, but I honestly couldn't help thinking this while reading, without ever having seen another review. The plot revolves around Harry Potter's son, Albus, dealing with the insecurities and ""consequences"" of being the hero of the wizarding world's son. A rift is sown between father and son that continues to grow, despite Harry's best intentions, leading to a series of unfortunate events, beginning with Albus using a time-turner to go back in time to attempt to change the past along with his best friend Scorpius, and the mysterious newcomer, Delphi Diggory. Albus gets more than he bargained for when his meddling sets off a butterfly effect of negative changes to the future. Now he has to try to correct his mistake and save the future, while unaware of the dangers around him.... It sounds interesting enough, but it somehow falls short. The characters are 2 dimensional and out of character. The dialogue and plot are watered down and unrealistic/unbelievable. And great Scott, there are SO many plot holes. I guess I just expected something different. I wanted to go back to Hogwarts and watch Albus grow from there. I wasn't completely against them revisiting scenes from the previous books, because I was curious to see them (briefly) played out in a different way, or as a means to show Albus glimpses of his father's life to give him a different perspective about him. However, I would have much preferred a look into Albus' life at Hogwarts, along with Scorpius, to really understand him and his issues, not a fast-forward synopsis of his life and first 4 years in Hogwarts, minimizing his issues and making it hard to relate to him. Don't get me wrong, there is still good here, but just so much wrong. Let's go now to the specifics: BIG SPOILERS ahead: Good Points: 1. I actually liked seeing this more gentle and affectionate Ron. People might compare him to the movie version, but I think this is in line with what a more grown-up Ron would be like (although maybe a bit more hot-tempered). I think surviving the war, marrying the love of his life, having children, losing Fred, and having overcome his most of his insecurities would mellow him out. 2. Hermione and Ron together. Even in the alternate realities where they weren't always ""together,"" they still loved each other. They're meant to be. 3. Scorpius- how can you not like him? The most likeable character in the play. He has the intelligence/geekiness of Hermione, the positivity of Luna, and the heart of Neville. What's not to like? 4. Scorpius and Rose. Their relationship served as another way to bring together the most opposing houses in Hogwarts. And knowing that Draco had a thing for Hermione makes it better because it's the realization of what could never be, in a positive way. Negative Points: 1. The dialogue was simplistic, robbing the characters of life and personality, and yet somehow, still making them seem out of character. What happened to the clever Hermione? The feisty and strong-headed Ginny? The calm and wise Dumbledore? And Harry? I don't think Harry would have ever said that to Albus, nor would he have acted like a total jerk and dictator and prevented him from seeing Scorpius. 2. The ""issue"" between Albus and Harry. I could have really understood how being Harry's son could be a problem, unfortunately the way it played out was so poorly done it sometimes felt illogical. Maybe it's because time went by so fast or because I'm not visually seeing it played out, but I'm still scratching my head as to the real issue between them, why he was so harsh/unsympathetic to Harry or why he was so hung up on bringing Cedric back. I guess I just couldn't really connect to Albus. 3. Why do the time-turners work differently here? Remember in the book how changes from the future were already being played out in the present (past) during the Dementor attack? There were no alternate realities, no butterfly effects. This is supposed to be cannon? 4. Time-turners again. As soon as I saw the word time-turner I knew Albus would be going back in the past to try to change things, but I never thought he would try to do it so cheaply. ""Hey, let's engorgio Cedric's head so he gets humiliated and doesn't win the Triwizard cup. That will change everything."" I mean, he really couldn't think of a better plot? Speaking of poorly thought out ideas- Delphi. Why the heck wouldn't Delphi just take the time-turner from the very beginning and go to Voldemort? Why even bother with ""the kids"" and with Cedric?? 5. You're telling me that good, kind, and honorable Cedric would have turned out to be a Death Eater if he hadn't won the Triwizard cup? What? What?? That is so ridiculous and eye-roll worthy. 6. What happened to the other characters? Where are George and the other Weasleys? Why is Ron running the joke shop? Why is he not an Auror? Where are the other Potter and Weasley kids? It's like they don't exist. 7. So Harry Potter, the Auror, savior of the wizarding world, Head of Magical Law Enforcement is now a weenie and can't even take on an 18 year old witch. Yeah, that's right. Are your eyes rolling too? 8. The worst and most unbelievable, incongruous portion of all. Voldemort has a freaking daughter!!?? Are you kidding me?! There is NO way. The only time I can picture Voldemort being remotely interested in pleasure of the body is when he was still young with a complete soul. After that, I don't think he was even capable of wanting it, especially having no love. Plus, I don't believe he would ever risk producing an heir; and heir would be competition. A child would weaken him, ""take"" from his being, likely his power. Somebody who could usurp him- a threat. I could sooner seen him making out with Nagini. Add on top of this that, Bellatrix would have been very pregnant around the time that the trio were taken prisoners to the Malfoy Mansion, so it's just a bunch of bologna. That being said, I realize that this is supposed to be a play and as such I am missing much of the non-verbal communication, acting, and emotion that goes behind it, but it's only a partial excuse. Macbeth was a play... so was the Crucible. That should say enough. I was torn between a 2 and 3 star, but I realized that in all honesty, had this not been ""Harry Potter,"" it would never be a three star. With Jo being so meticulous, I can't understand how she approved this. Not the concept in general, just the direction and specifics. My best advice would be watch the play first.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

10974,1984806734,4.0,Entertaining and reflective,,"Loved the overall premise and bantering between the 2 main characters. Rom com author January Andrews has had a reality check within the last year. Everything she thought she knew about life and love seems to have been obliterated with her father's passing and it shattered her rose colored glasses. With nowhere to go, she hides out in North Bear Shores to work on a book that she has yet to conceive and to write, but the deadline is looming over her head. Next door to her happens to be Augustus Everett, who is also an author and former college classmate from a decade ago.January wears her heart on her sleeve. She's full of emotion and expression, always fully transparent on her face. She's having trouble adjusting to the notion that her dad might not have been who she thought he was and she's not sure how to come to terms with it because no matter what, he was always the best dad to her. She's not certain she'll ever get the answers she wants and truthfully, January is not entirely sure she can handle it anyway. Gus, on the other hand, has a very cynical view of reality and is always waiting for the other shoe to drop. He doesn't like messy emotions and is very guarded. January and he are complete opposites but yet both of them are having writer's block so it seems to work out when they make a deal to ensure they get their books written.Really enjoyed the chemistry between them and how secretive Gus came off although it was apparent that January got under his skin like no one else. I also was completely intrigued by January unraveling the mystery behind her father in terms of trying to find out what kind of man he truly was. The exchanges between Gus and January are thought provoking because of how differently they see the world and are bending towards the other in their views. There are a lot of funny conversations, too, with these moments that seem to be completely Kodak in style, but then there's always this little thing that slightly blemishes it in terms of humor or real life that cracked me up. The cover and title makes it seem like a light and breezy read, but I would say the content is more substantial and emotional than that.",False,romance,Language.ENGLISH

He is in a unique position to describe first hand the trials of poverty, physical abuse, social isolation, and racism that he experienced. Most of all, his stories provide a beautifully drawn portrait of his mother, a fascinating character who is so independent she bends to none of the societal rules swirling around her and yet who succumbs to being dominated for a time by an abusive husband. She is tough and loving and funny and unwavering in her convictions. And she manages to rise above poverty and discrimination using her intelligence and work ethic to provide for her family as a single working mother of a mixed race child in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa.

Especially when you consider that neither of these books was the first in the genre; while Huxley predated Orwell by seventeen years, somehow Zamyatin's WE, written a decade before BNW, often gets left out of the discussion (in fact it has been some time since I read WE, and I read two different translations, so I would need to tackle it again to review it properly).  And there are other novels in this genre that are worthy of consideration, such as Levin's THIS PERFECT DAY and Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451.  But at the end of the day, when it comes to the ultimate dystopia, it is Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR that emerges as the absolute expression of the genre in all its nightmarish vividness.London, 1984 (Or is it? Nothing is certain in this book).  We are introduced to Winston Smith, a clerical worker for the ruling body, an entity known only as ""the Party"" and represented by posters of a Stalin-like figure known only as ""Big Brother"" and the slogan ""Big Brother Is Watching You.""  Which is literally true:  everyone's apartment is equipped with a two-way television (""telescreen"") that sees and hears absolutely everything, from eating to sleep to sex, and which can be turned down but not off.Winston's job sums up the Party pretty well:  it is his task to process changes to newspapers, history books, magazines, any form of literature so that the present will match up with the past.  In short, it is his function to completely obliterate history on a daily basis.  The world is divided into three primary ""provinces:""  Oceania (in which London is located and which oddly appears to include the United States), Eurasia, and Eastasia.  There is always a war going on between Oceania and one of the other two, but it is subject to change on a dime, and when it does, Winston and his team must scramble to change all records to make them state that Oceania has ALWAYS been at war with whichever one happens to be the enemy at the moment.It is instructive that Winston performs his duties at a place called the Ministry of Truth, which is in fact dedicated to falsification of everything from history books to television shows.  There are two other Ministries:  The Ministry of Peace, which is concerned with war, and the Ministry of Love, which is concerned with horrors that I will not reveal here.Speaking of love, this is where comparisons with Huxley actually have some merit.  Both novels have removed all meaning from the sex act.  But Huxley does it by making promiscuity the order of the day and making any feelings deeper than the basic tactile sexual sensations deviant, unnatural, and anti-social.  Orwell does it by making sex a crime except for the necessity of procreation and in his world pleasure for the woman is the unnatural thing.  Winston has a wife (who left him some time earlier), but the descriptions of their couplings are bone-chilling:  a dedicated Party member, his wife hated sex but insisted that they do it once a week to make a baby, calling it (God help us all) ""Our duty to the Party.""  Winston's relief at her departure is almost palpable even though we only hear about it as a past event.Slogans abound in Orwell's world.  The three primary ones are WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH, all of which eerily recall the words that greeted the prisoners arriving at Auschwitz:  ARBECHT MACHT FREI (literally ""Work Makes One Free"" but more accurately ""Freedom Through Work"").Orwell does not limit his inspirations to Nazi Germany, though:  I have already mentioned the resemblance between the mythical ""Big Brother"" and Josef Stalin; his characters address each other as ""comrade"" and there is mention made on more than one occasion of work camps that sound more like Siberia than WWII Germany.Orwell was an unremitting pessimist.  The plot of his novel is so simple it is almost predictable:  Winston is an unhappy member of the Party, and unhappy people sooner or later do something rebellious.  Winston rebels, with a young woman named Julia, and there follows a brief period where things appear to be hopeful, but eventually the hammer falls, and the ending is almost preordained.Which brings us to the one other valid comparison to Huxley; in BNW, London is a city so sterile you could probably eat off the floors.  NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, on the other hand, is so grimy that you almost want to wash your hands after reading it.  The only other novel I can think of that presents the reader with such an unrelentingly gritty vision of the future is Harry Harrison's MAKE ROOM!  MAKE ROOM!, the inspiration for the film SOYLENT GREEN.There are a lot of futuristic dystopias out there, and they tend to share various features:  the genre is a narrow one, rather like horror and science fiction, and some crossover is inevitable.  But NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR stands out, somehow, above all the others; it has a grim resonance that is not only rather depressing but one gets the feeling that his vision is not in the least bit impossible and that we would do well to take care that we do not end up in Oceania.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

12452,786965606,5.0,Doesn't replace 3.5 but provides streamlined rules for different kind of play (or players),11 people found this helpful,"I play 3.5 and love/hate it.  Mostly I love it but sometimes the rules get me frustrated when all I want to do is role-play and I need like 3 skills, a feat, and I have to make like 3 checks just to jump over a table (before anybody posts, this is an exaggeration - but my DM would force me to make at least a jump and balance check).BUT, all the rules, and books, and home-brew stuff (and pathfinder) are also great.  There is a rule for everything, even some that make no sense, but hey, there's a rule for that.  And yet 3.5 remains incredibly flexible, and breakable, but then the DM rolls out broken monsters and its great.  Never really played 2nd or 1st edition but some people really like em'.  3.5 didn't replace them and 5th edition didn't replace 3.5.3.5 is still out there and will continue to be played and remains a very easy system to adapt and modify.But 3.5 isn't always easy system to play, and 5th is.  And that's a good thing.Because 5th edition DOES replace 4th IMHO.  If you are going to make the game easier to play, don't focus on combat, which 4th edition did. But 5th edition focuses on role-play, the whole point of DND for me personally.  Role-play and play freedom, let me explain.5th edition IS streamlined (major overhaul, skills pretty much gone - A/C is super simple - no more 5 foot steps, modifiers are much reduced) and it has game mechanics that promote role-play and even tables for rolling traits, bonds, and even flaws (personality, not physical) such as, ""if there is a plan you forget or ignore it.""  Do you have to follow this?  No, but if you do you gain inspiration points that give you advantage on a roll.  Basically you get to roll 2 dice.  The math on rolling two dice is a lot simpler than, mod here, ranks this, plus misc. mod this equals...  Now it boils down to, 2 is better than one.  All of this serves to make the game a lot more approachable to new players, but not by trying to sell them on combat (like 4e did) which will never work because none of us play the game for combat (or at least no one I know).If you want streamlined combat well... video games are making millions (maybe billions?) of dollars a year for a reason.But why does tabletop gaming have it all over video games though?  Freedom to do ANYTHING.  3.5 gave us one kind of freedom (I can't speak of 2nd edition or anything earlier) by giving us a huge amount of rules and options to draw from that if you were willing to commit yourself to learning, provided literally limitless options.  COmbat was fun in this context because you came up with some bizare cross-class with certain feats and items that allowed you to do something unique and interesting and power (sometimes totally broken).5th edition gives us a different kind of freedom with much simplified rules that are more intuitive.  All checks match to an ability (even saves) proficiency makes it much more intuitive for the lay person too.  You want to jump over that table? Roll 1d20, plus dex modifier (obviously).  Are you proficient, add 2, done.  One roll, make it?  Cool.  It's also easier on the DM.  I would feel comfortable DMing 5th edition and I am trying to talk my friends into trying it out with me because I think they could handle the system and would enjoy knowing what the hell they were doing.  I have been selling my friends on table-top rpgs for years on the basis that ""you can do literally anything"" but I have done a lot of the math for them.  Now I think they could handle their own characters stats.  Also,I think the role-play rules will be great for my friends who are reluctant to come out of their shells right away.It's not always about breaking the game, and WOTC has clearly tried to unbreakable a lot of things and put rational floors and ceilings (and reduce min-maxing).  Yes, it feels more limited in this fashion, but it sucks in 3.5 when one player has an A/C of 31 and everyone else in the party has an A/C around 20.  5th edition reduces this possibility by reducing possibilities, but that opens up the world to your imagination over thinking only in terms of game mechanics.  This is good for people who don't want to spend hours thinking about character creation and just want to play and not be told, sorry, you can't climb that because you don't have ranks in climb.I know that pathfinder addressed some of these issues but that is still more ""hardcore"" that 5th edition IMHO.And that's a good thing!  If you don't have friends that you would like to game with who aren't into all the rules or are intimidated by RPGs, or you have never thought to yourself, man I just want to jump in and play instead of looking-up specifics half the time, then ignore this reivew (and this edition).If you are perfectly happy with 3.5 and/or pathfinder, awesome.  It's not going anywhere. I know I will keep playing both.But 5th edition is a happy addition to my shelf (where 4th was not) because it offers a different way to play the game, and a system that is very good in my opinion; the care, and play-testing really shows!Are there problems?  Yes, the dragon-born draconic bloodline sorcerer thing is weird... Also dragonborn seem a little broken to me compared to other races, although all the races have received some love.  I really enjoy the specifics of forest versus rock gnomes, hill dwarves versus mountain dwarves, and the flavor text is great!Do I need the book to give me little blurbs on dwarf racial characteristics, what they are like, how they treat other races?  No.  But it's fun, and immersive.  Do I need the book to give me sub-race characteristics?  No, I could (or the DM could) do that on my/her own right.  Could I streamline 3.5 rules? Yes, but I would probably spend a lot of time getting the kinks out.  I've tried actually.  But hey, do I eve need any book at all?  I could just make up all the rules!  I could completely invent my own game!  And I bet it wouldn't be half as good as this one.And in terms of what you pay for, it's great to get a flavor text, and a pretty complete system (I could DM a game right out of the PHB, there are even monsters in the back!) and the art!The art is truly the best I have seen!  I love to flip through the older books for the art, I am dorky like that.  And 3.5 has some good art, and some is, OK.  Pathfidner had a great art style IMHO.  But the art in this edition raises the bar!  and it is well integrated onto each highly readable page.  I would like to note that I appreciate the lack of chain-mail bikinis.  Once again, I am trying to get MORE of my friends to play, not fewer.  The art would attract many and offend few.  Which is a good thing.So, in terms of what you pay for, good system, good layout, immersive flavor text and play ideas, and amazing art across every page.  And it's complete enough you could DM right out of the PHB.  At 50 bucks it's a good deal, at 30 its a steal!But best of all, 3.5 still exists!  But this edition makes the tabletop gaming library more versatile and appealing.  IF you think that's a good thing, and want to try a new take on a great game, I highly recommend this edition (for what it is - which isn't 3.75).If your happy with what your playing.  Then happy gaming!",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH

Also the writing, I know it is a play but this is so basic. It reads, as others have stated, as a mediocre piece of fan fiction. The best thing about this is probably the character of Scorpius Malfoy. The low point - realizing that Ron is nothing more than a bumbling fool who was drunk when he married Hermione and now runs the joke shop. It doesn't mesh up with the Ron we know.

5281,1982137452,1.0,THE worst book I have EVER read!,95,"I usually never write reviews, but I had to for this one so that hopefully I can spare another reader the agony I experienced reading this book. First of all, the premise was good, and I thought that that was what the book was going to be about; a newly engaged woman wakes up 5 years in the future in a different place engaged to a different man. That had possibilities - which reality is valid? Can she choose the one she wants...etc. However, halfway through the book, the story took a dramatic shift and went downhill from there. It was depressing, scary, sad, and completely unnecessary. I don't know why the author chose to go down that path, but this reader did NOT appreciate it. I don't read books to get depressed, and there was nothing in the previews to indicate the downturn this book would take. Yes, life takes downturns like that, but I read books to ESCAPE that reality. I feel betrayed somehow, because this is not the story I expected to read. Buyers should be aware that this is not the story the book jacket hints at. If you want to be literally depressed, read this book. If you don't, avoid it like the plague.",True,children,Language.ENGLISH

Your students will make you read it to them over and over.  It introduces colors and animals in a simple yet imaginative way.  The illustrations are great.  The story asks certain animals what they see to which they answer what they see looking at them. The book finishes with a summary of all the animals that the children have seen.This book could be used in the school setting as an interactive read-aloud.

Student can anticipate what is going to appear next in the book. Students can test their memory through recall and can they can sequence the order in which everything appeared.

Bradbury tells of a society where books are banned and 'firemen' are employed to burn down houses where hidden books are found. The populace has become insular, unfeeling and numbed by the constant TV screens in their homes showing never ending bland entertainment and by the earpieces that whisper soothing sounds or music into their ears (sound a little familiar?). No one engages any more with the rest of society, except to watch the screens together. The men work at undemanding jobs and no one is aware of the constant wars being waged in far away countries.Guy Montag is a fireman who begins to wake up when he starts stealing books from houses that he is sent to burn down. He starts to wonder why they are banned from reading these books. Bradbury goes on to tell us what happens to Guy as colour and feelings return to his life and he wonders about the world men have built for themselves. A simple but powerful story told by a skilled writer and one that still resonates today.",True,humor_entertainment,Language.ENGLISH
